/// ## Requirements
/// * The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build-time to point to a database
/// server with the schema that the query string will be checked against. All variants of `query!()`
/// use [dotenv] so this can be in a `.env` file instead.
///
///     * Or, `sqlx-data.json` must exist at the workspace root. See [Offline Mode](#offline-mode)
///       below.
///
/// * The query must be a string literal, or concatenation of string literals using `+` (useful
/// for queries generated by macro), or else it cannot be introspected (and thus cannot be dynamic
/// or the result of another macro).
///
/// * The `QueryAs` instance will be bound to the same database type as `query!()` was compiled
/// against (e.g. you cannot build against a Postgres database and then run the query against
/// a MySQL database).
///
///     * The schema of the database URL (e.g. `postgres://` or `mysql://`) will be used to
///       determine the database type.
///
/// [dotenv]: https://crates.io/crates/dotenv
/// ## Query Arguments
/// Like `println!()` and the other formatting macros, you can add bind parameters to your SQL
/// and this macro will typecheck passed arguments and error on missing ones:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// # use sqlx::Connect;
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "mysql", feature = "_rt-async-std"))]
/// # #[async_std::main]
/// # async fn main() -> sqlx::Result<()>{
/// # let db_url = dotenv::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
/// #
/// # if !(db_url.starts_with("mysql") || db_url.starts_with("mariadb")) { return Ok(()) }
/// # let mut conn = sqlx::mysql::MySqlConnection::connect(db_url).await?;
/// // let mut conn = <impl sqlx::Executor>;
/// let account = sqlx::query!(
///         // just pretend "accounts" is a real table
///         "select * from (select (1) as id, 'Herp Derpinson' as name) accounts where id = ?",
///         1i32
///     )
///     .fetch_one(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
///
/// println!("{:?}", account);
/// println!("{}: {}", account.id, account.name);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// #
/// # #[cfg(any(not(feature = "mysql"), not(feature = "_rt-async-std")))]
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// Bind parameters in the SQL string are specific to the database backend:
///
/// * Postgres: `$N` where `N` is the 1-based positional argument index
/// * MySQL/SQLite: `?` which matches arguments in order that it appears in the query
///
/// ## Nullability: Bind Parameters
/// For a given expected type `T`, both `T` and `Option<T>` are allowed (as well as either
/// behind references). `Option::None` will be bound as `NULL`, so if binding a type behind `Option`
/// be sure your query can support it.
///
/// Note, however, if binding in a `where` clause, that equality comparisons with `NULL` may not
/// work as expected; instead you must use `IS NOT NULL` or `IS NULL` to check if a column is not
/// null or is null, respectively.
///
/// In Postgres and MySQL you may also use `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` to compare with a possibly
/// `NULL` value. In MySQL `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` can be shortened to `<=>`.
/// In SQLite you can us `IS` or `IS NOT`. Note that operator precedence may be different.
///
/// ## Nullability: Output Columns
/// In most cases, the database engine can tell us whether or not a column may be `NULL`, and
/// the `query!()` macro adjusts the field types of the returned struct accordingly.
///
/// For Postgres, this only works for columns which come directly from actual tables,
/// as the implementation will need to query the table metadata to find if a given column
/// has a `NOT NULL` constraint. Columns that do not have a `NOT NULL` constraint or are the result
/// of an expression are assumed to be nullable and so `Option<T>` is used instead of `T`.
///
/// For MySQL, the implementation looks at [the `NOT_NULL` flag](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/8.0.12/group__group__cs__column__definition__flags.html#ga50377f5ca5b3e92f3931a81fe7b44043)
/// of [the `ColumnDefinition` structure in `COM_QUERY_OK`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/com-query-response.html#column-definition):
/// if it is set, `T` is used; if it is not set, `Option<T>` is used.
///
/// MySQL appears to be capable of determining the nullability of a result column even if it
/// is the result of an expression, depending on if the expression may in any case result in
/// `NULL` which then depends on the semantics of what functions are used. Consult the MySQL
/// manual for the functions you are using to find the cases in which they return `NULL`.
///
/// For SQLite we perform a similar check to Postgres, looking for `NOT NULL` constraints
/// on columns that come from tables. However, for SQLite we also can step through the output
/// of `EXPLAIN` to identify columns that may or may not be `NULL`.
///
/// To override the nullability of an output column, [see below](#type-overrides-output-columns).
///
/// ## Type Overrides: Bind Parameters (Postgres only)
/// For typechecking of bind parameters, casts using `as` are treated as overrides for the inferred
/// types of bind parameters and no typechecking is emitted:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// #[derive(sqlx::Type)]
/// #[sqlx(transparent)]
/// struct MyInt4(i32);
///
/// let my_int = MyInt4(1);
///
/// sqlx::query!("select $1::int4 as id", my_int as MyInt4)
/// ```
///
/// In Rust 1.45 we can eliminate this redundancy by allowing casts using `as _` or type ascription
/// syntax, i.e. `my_int: _` (which is unstable but can be stripped), but this requires modifying
/// the expression which is not possible as the macros are currently implemented. Casts to `_` are
/// forbidden for now as they produce rather nasty type errors.
///
/// ## Type Overrides: Output Columns
/// Type overrides are also available for output columns, utilizing the SQL standard's support
/// for arbitrary text in column names:
///
/// ##### Force Not-Null
/// Selecting a column `foo as "foo!"` (Postgres / SQLite) or `` foo as `foo!` `` (MySQL) overrides
/// inferred nullability and forces the column to be treated as `NOT NULL`; this is useful e.g. for
/// selecting expressions in Postgres where we cannot infer nullability:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// # async fn main() {
/// # let mut conn = panic!();
/// // Postgres: using a raw query string lets us use unescaped double-quotes
/// // Note that this query wouldn't work in SQLite as we still don't know the exact type of `id`
/// let record = sqlx::query!(r#"select 1 as "id!""#) // MySQL: use "select 1 as `id!`" instead
///     .fetch_one(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
///
/// // For Postgres this would have been inferred to be Option<i32> instead
/// assert_eq!(record.id, 1i32);
/// # }
///
/// ```
///
/// ##### Force Nullable
/// Selecting a column `foo as "foo?"` (Postgres / SQLite) or `` foo as `foo?` `` (MySQL) overrides
/// inferred nullability and forces the column to be treated as nullable; this is provided mainly
/// for symmetry with `!`.
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// # async fn main() {
/// # let mut conn = panic!();
/// // Postgres/SQLite:
/// let record = sqlx::query!(r#"select 1 as "id?""#) // MySQL: use "select 1 as `id?`" instead
///     .fetch_one(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
///
/// // For Postgres this would have been inferred to be Option<i32> anyway
/// // but this is just a basic example
/// assert_eq!(record.id, Some(1i32));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// MySQL should be accurate with regards to nullability as it directly tells us when a column is
/// expected to never be `NULL`. Any mistakes should be considered a bug in MySQL.
///
/// However, inference in SQLite and Postgres is more fragile as it depends primarily on observing
/// `NOT NULL` constraints on columns. If a `NOT NULL` column is brought in by a `LEFT JOIN` then
/// that column may be `NULL` if its row does not satisfy the join condition. Similarly, a
/// `FULL JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN` may generate rows from the primary table that are all `NULL`.
///
/// Unfortunately, the result of mistakes in inference is a `UnexpectedNull` error at runtime.
///
/// In Postgres, we patch up this inference by analyzing `EXPLAIN VERBOSE` output (which is not
/// well documented, is highly dependent on the query plan that Postgres generates, and may differ
/// between releases) to find columns that are the result of left/right/full outer joins. This
/// analysis errs on the side of producing false positives (marking columns nullable that are not
/// in practice) but there are likely edge cases that it does not cover yet.
///
/// Using `?` as an override we can fix this for columns we know to be nullable in practice:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// # async fn main() {
/// # let mut conn = panic!();
/// // Ironically this is the exact column we primarily look at to determine nullability in Postgres
/// let record = sqlx::query!(
///     r#"select attnotnull as "attnotnull?" from (values (1)) ids left join pg_attribute on false"#
/// )
/// .fetch_one(&mut conn)
/// .await?;
///
/// // Although we do our best, under Postgres this might have been inferred to be `bool`
/// // In that case, we would have gotten an error
/// assert_eq!(record.attnotnull, None);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// If you find that you need to use this override, please open an issue with a query we can use
/// to reproduce the problem. For Postgres users, especially helpful would be the output of
/// `EXPLAIN (VERBOSE, FORMAT JSON) <your query>` with bind parameters substituted in the query
/// (as the exact value of bind parameters can change the query plan)
/// and the definitions of any relevant tables (or sufficiently anonymized equivalents).
///
/// ##### Force a Different/Custom Type
/// Selecting a column `foo as "foo: T"` (Postgres / SQLite) or `` foo as `foo: T` `` (MySQL)
/// overrides the inferred type which is useful when selecting user-defined custom types
/// (dynamic type checking is still done so if the types are incompatible this will be an error
/// at runtime instead of compile-time). Note that this syntax alone doesn't override inferred nullability,
/// but it is compatible with the forced not-null and forced nullable annotations:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// # async fn main() {
/// # let mut conn = panic!();
/// #[derive(sqlx::Type)]
/// #[sqlx(transparent)
/// struct MyInt4(i32);
///
/// let my_int = MyInt4(1);
///
/// // Postgres/SQLite
/// sqlx::query!(r#"select 1 as "id!: MyInt4""#) // MySQL: use "select 1 as `id: MyInt4`" instead
///     .fetch_one(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
///
/// // For Postgres this would have been inferred to be `Option<i32>`, MySQL/SQLite `i32`
/// // Note that while using `id: MyInt4` (without the `!`) would work the same for MySQL/SQLite,
/// // Postgres would expect `Some(MyInt4(1))` and the code wouldn't compile
/// assert_eq!(record.id, MyInt4(1));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ##### Overrides cheatsheet
///
/// | Syntax    | Nullability     | Type       |
/// | --------- | --------------- | ---------- |
/// | `foo!`    | Forced not-null | Inferred   |
/// | `foo?`    | Forced nullable | Inferred   |
/// | `foo: T`  | Inferred        | Overridden |

/// ## Offline Mode (requires the `offline` feature)
/// The macros can be configured to not require a live database connection for compilation,
/// but it requires a couple extra steps:
///
/// * Run `cargo install sqlx-cli`.
/// * In your project with `DATABASE_URL` set (or in a `.env` file) and the database server running,
///   run `cargo sqlx prepare`.
/// * Check the generated `sqlx-data.json` file into version control.
/// * Don't have `DATABASE_URL` set during compilation.
///
/// Your project can now be built without a database connection (you must omit `DATABASE_URL` or
/// else it will still try to connect). To update the generated file simply run `cargo sqlx prepare`
/// again.
///
/// To ensure that your `sqlx-data.json` file is kept up-to-date, both with the queries in your

/// it causes that column to be inferred based on the type of the corresponding field in the given
/// record struct. Runtime type-checking is still done so an error will be emitted if the types
/// are not compatible.
///
/// This allows you to override the inferred type of a column to instead use a custom-defined type:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// #[derive(sqlx::Type)]
/// #[sqlx(transparent)]
/// struct MyInt4(i32);
///
/// struct Record {
///     id: MyInt4,
/// }
///
/// let my_int = MyInt4(1);
///
/// // Postgres/SQLite
/// sqlx::query_as!(Record, r#"select 1 as "id: _""#) // MySQL: use "select 1 as `id: _`" instead

/// ```
///
/// ### Troubleshooting: "error: mismatched types"
/// If you get a "mismatched types" error from an invocation of this macro and the error
/// isn't pointing specifically at a parameter.
///
/// For example, code like this (using a Postgres database):
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// struct Account {
///     id: i32,
///     name: Option<String>,
/// }
///
/// let account = sqlx::query_as!(
///     Account,
///     r#"SELECT id, name from (VALUES (1, 'Herp Derpinson')) accounts(id, name)"#,
/// )
///     .fetch_one(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
/// ```
///
/// Might produce an error like this:
/// ```text,ignore
/// error[E0308]: mismatched types
///    --> tests/postgres/macros.rs:126:19
///     |
/// 126 |       let account = sqlx::query_as!(
///     |  ___________________^
/// 127 | |         Account,
/// 128 | |         r#"SELECT id, name from (VALUES (1, 'Herp Derpinson')) accounts(id, name)"#,
/// 129 | |     )
///     | |_____^ expected `i32`, found enum `std::option::Option`
///     |
///     = note: expected type `i32`
///                found enum `std::option::Option<i32>`
/// ```
///
/// This means that you need to check that any field of the "expected" type (here, `i32`) matches
/// the Rust type mapping for its corresponding SQL column (see the `types` module of your database,
/// listed above, for mappings). The "found" type is the SQL->Rust mapping that the macro chose.
///
/// In the above example, the returned column is inferred to be nullable because it's being
/// returned from a `VALUES` statement in Postgres, so the macro inferred the field to be nullable
/// and so used `Option<i32>` instead of `i32`. **In this specific case** we could use
/// `select id as "id!"` to override the inferred nullability because we know in practice
/// that column will never be `NULL` and it will fix the error.
///
