//! Abstractions for asynchronous programming.
//!
//! This crate provides a number of core abstractions for writing asynchronous
//! code:
//!
//! - [Futures](crate::future) are single eventual values produced by
//!   asynchronous computations. Some programming languages (e.g. JavaScript)
//!   call this concept "promise".
//! - [Streams](crate::stream) represent a series of values
//!   produced asynchronously.
//! - [Sinks](crate::sink) provide support for asynchronous writing of
//!   data.
//! - [Executors](crate::executor) are responsible for running asynchronous
//!   tasks.
//!
//! The crate also contains abstractions for [asynchronous I/O](crate::io) and
//! [cross-task communication](crate::channel).
//!
//! Underlying all of this is the *task system*, which is a form of lightweight
//! threading. Large asynchronous computations are built up using futures,
//! streams and sinks, and then spawned as independent tasks that are run to
//! completion, but *do not block* the thread running them.
//!
//! The following example describes how the task system context is built and used
//! within macros and keywords such as async and await!.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use futures::channel::mpsc;
//! # use futures::executor; ///standard executors to provide a context for futures and streams
//! # use futures::executor::ThreadPool;
//! # use futures::StreamExt;
//! #
//! fn main() {
//!     let pool = ThreadPool::new().expect("Failed to build pool");
//!     let (tx, rx) = mpsc::unbounded::<i32>();
//!
//!     // Create a future by an async block, where async is responsible for an
//!     // implementation of Future. At this point no executor has been provided
//!     // to this future, so it will not be running.
//!     let fut_values = async {
//!         // Create another async block, again where the Future implementation
//!         // is generated by async. Since this is inside of a parent async block,
//!         // it will be provided with the executor of the parent block when the parent
//!         // block is executed.
//!         //
//!         // This executor chaining is done by Future::poll whose second argument
//!         // is a std::task::Context. This represents our executor, and the Future
//!         // implemented by this async block can be polled using the parent async
//!         // block's executor.
//!         let fut_tx_result = async move {
//!             (0..100).for_each(|v| {
//!                 tx.unbounded_send(v).expect("Failed to send");
//!             })
//!         };
//!
//!         // Use the provided thread pool to spawn the generated future
//!         // responsible for transmission
//!         pool.spawn_ok(fut_tx_result);
//!
//!         let fut_values = rx
//!             .map(|v| v * 2)
//!             .collect();
//!
//!         // Use the executor provided to this async block to wait for the
//!         // future to complete.
//!         fut_values.await
//!     };
//!
//!     // Actually execute the above future, which will invoke Future::poll and
//!     // subsequenty chain appropriate Future::poll and methods needing executors
//!     // to drive all futures. Eventually fut_values will be driven to completion.
//!     let values: Vec<i32> = executor::block_on(fut_values);
//!
//!     println!("Values={:?}", values);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The majority of examples and code snippets in this crate assume that they are
//! inside an async block as written above.
