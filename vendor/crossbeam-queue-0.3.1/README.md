This crate provides concurrent queues that can be shared among threads:

* [`ArrayQueue`], a bounded MPMC queue that allocates a fixed-capacity buffer on construction.
* [`SegQueue`], an unbounded MPMC queue that allocates small buffers, segments, on demand.

[`ArrayQueue`]: https://docs.rs/crossbeam-queue/*/crossbeam_queue/struct.ArrayQueue.html
[`SegQueue`]: https://docs.rs/crossbeam-queue/*/crossbeam_queue/struct.SegQueue.html

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml

```

## Compatibility

Crossbeam Queue supports stable Rust releases going back at least six months,
and every time the minimum supported Rust version is increased, a new minor
version is released. Currently, the minimum supported Rust version is 1.36.
