/// A synchronization primitive for task wakeup.
///
/// Sometimes the task interested in a given event will change over time.
/// An `AtomicWaker` can coordinate concurrent notifications with the consumer
/// potentially "updating" the underlying task to wake up. This is useful in
/// scenarios where a computation completes in another thread and wants to
/// notify the consumer, but the consumer is in the process of being migrated to
/// a new logical task.
///
/// Consumers should call `register` before checking the result of a computation
/// and producers should call `wake` after producing the computation (this
/// differs from the usual `thread::park` pattern). It is also permitted for
/// `wake` to be called **before** `register`. This results in a no-op.
///
/// A single `AtomicWaker` may be reused for any number of calls to `register` or
/// `wake`.
///
/// # Memory ordering
///
/// Calling `register` "acquires" all memory "released" by calls to `wake`
/// before the call to `register`.  Later calls to `wake` will wake the
/// registered waker (on contention this wake might be triggered in `register`).
///
/// For concurrent calls to `register` (should be avoided) the ordering is only
/// guaranteed for the winning call.

// `AtomicWaker` is a multi-consumer, single-producer transfer cell. The cell
// stores a `Waker` value produced by calls to `register` and many threads can
// race to take the waker (to wake it) by calling `wake`.
//
// If a new `Waker` instance is produced by calling `register` before an
// existing one is consumed, then the existing one is overwritten.
//
// While `AtomicWaker` is single-producer, the implementation ensures memory
// safety. In the event of concurrent calls to `register`, there will be a
// single winner whose waker will get stored in the cell. The losers will not
// have their tasks woken. As such, callers should ensure to add synchronization
// to calls to `register`.
//
// The implementation uses a single `AtomicUsize` value to coordinate access to
// the `Waker` cell. There are two bits that are operated on independently.
// These are represented by `REGISTERING` and `WAKING`.
//
// The `REGISTERING` bit is set when a producer enters the critical section. The
// `WAKING` bit is set when a consumer enters the critical section. Neither bit
// being set is represented by `WAITING`.
//
// A thread obtains an exclusive lock on the waker cell by transitioning the
// state from `WAITING` to `REGISTERING` or `WAKING`, depending on the operation
// the thread wishes to perform. When this transition is made, it is guaranteed
// that no other thread will access the waker cell.
//
// # Registering
//
// On a call to `register`, an attempt to transition the state from WAITING to
// REGISTERING is made. On success, the caller obtains a lock on the waker cell.
//
// If the lock is obtained, then the thread sets the waker cell to the waker
// provided as an argument. Then it attempts to transition the state back from
// `REGISTERING` -> `WAITING`.
//
// If this transition is successful, then the registering process is complete
// and the next call to `wake` will observe the waker.
//
// If the transition fails, then there was a concurrent call to `wake` that was
// unable to access the waker cell (due to the registering thread holding the
// lock). To handle this, the registering thread removes the waker it just set
// from the cell and calls `wake` on it. This call to wake represents the
// attempt to wake by the other thread (that set the `WAKING` bit). The state is
// then transitioned from `REGISTERING | WAKING` back to `WAITING`.  This
// transition must succeed because, at this point, the state cannot be
// transitioned by another thread.
//
// # Waking
//
// On a call to `wake`, an attempt to transition the state from `WAITING` to
// `WAKING` is made. On success, the caller obtains a lock on the waker cell.
//
// If the lock is obtained, then the thread takes ownership of the current value
// in the waker cell, and calls `wake` on it. The state is then transitioned
// back to `WAITING`. This transition must succeed as, at this point, the state
// cannot be transitioned by another thread.
//
// If the thread is unable to obtain the lock, the `WAKING` bit is still.  This
// is because it has either been set by the current thread but the previous
// value included the `REGISTERING` bit **or** a concurrent thread is in the
// `WAKING` critical section. Either way, no action must be taken.
//
// If the current thread is the only concurrent call to `wake` and another
// thread is in the `register` critical section, when the other thread **exits**
// the `register` critical section, it will observe the `WAKING` bit and handle
// the wake itself.
//
// If another thread is in the `wake` critical section, then it will handle
// waking the task.
//
// # A potential race (is safely handled).
//
// Imagine the following situation:
//
// * Thread A obtains the `wake` lock and wakes a task.
//
// * Before thread A releases the `wake` lock, the woken task is scheduled.
//
// * Thread B attempts to wake the task. In theory this should result in the
//   task being woken, but it cannot because thread A still holds the wake lock.
//
// This case is handled by requiring users of `AtomicWaker` to call `register`
// **before** attempting to observe the application state change that resulted
// in the task being awoken. The wakers also change the application state before
// calling wake.
//
// Because of this, the waker will do one of two things.
//
// 1) Observe the application state change that Thread B is woken for. In this
//    case, it is OK for Thread B's wake to be lost.
//
// 2) Call register before attempting to observe the application state. Since
//    Thread A still holds the `wake` lock, the call to `register` will result
//    in the task waking itself and get scheduled again.
