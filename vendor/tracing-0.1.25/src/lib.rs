//! A scoped, structured logging and diagnostics system.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! `tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
//! structured, event-based diagnostic information.
//!
//! In asynchronous systems like Tokio, interpreting traditional log messages can
//! often be quite challenging. Since individual tasks are multiplexed on the same
//! thread, associated events and log lines are intermixed making it difficult to
//! trace the logic flow. `tracing` expands upon logging-style diagnostics by
//! allowing libraries and applications to record structured events with additional
//! information about *temporality* and *causality* — unlike a log message, a span
//! in `tracing` has a beginning and end time, may be entered and exited by the
//! flow of execution, and may exist within a nested tree of similar spans. In
//! addition, `tracing` spans are *structured*, with the ability to record typed
//! data as well as textual messages.
//!
//! The `tracing` crate provides the APIs necessary for instrumenting libraries
//! and applications to emit trace data.
//!
//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.42+][msrv]*
//!
//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! The core of `tracing`'s API is composed of _spans_, _events_ and
//! _subscribers_. We'll cover these in turn.
//!
//! ## Spans
//!
//! To record the flow of execution through a program, `tracing` introduces the
//! concept of [spans]. Unlike a log line that represents a _moment in
//! time_, a span represents a _period of time_ with a beginning and an end. When a
//! program begins executing in a context or performing a unit of work, it
//! _enters_ that context's span, and when it stops executing in that context,
//! it _exits_ the span. The span in which a thread is currently executing is
//! referred to as that thread's _current_ span.
//!
//! For example:
//! ```
//! use tracing::{span, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_span");
//! // `enter` returns a RAII guard which, when dropped, exits the span. this
//! // indicates that we are in the span for the current lexical scope.
//! let _enter = span.enter();
//! // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! The [`span` module][span]'s documentation provides further details on how to
//! use spans.
//!
//! <div class="information">
//!     <div class="tooltip compile_fail" style="">&#x26a0; &#xfe0f;<span class="tooltiptext">Warning</span></div>
//! </div><div class="example-wrap" style="display:inline-block"><pre class="compile_fail" style="white-space:normal;font:inherit;">
//!     <strong>Warning</strong>: In asynchronous code that uses async/await syntax,
//!     <code>Span::enter</code> may produce incorrect traces if the returned drop
//!     guard is held across an await point. See
//!     <a href="span/struct.Span.html#in-asynchronous-code">the method documentation</a>
//!     for details.
//! </pre></div>
//!
//! ## Events
//!
//! An [`Event`] represents a _moment_ in time. It signifies something that
//! happened while a trace was being recorded. `Event`s are comparable to the log
//! records emitted by unstructured logging code, but unlike a typical log line,
//! an `Event` may occur within the context of a span.
//!
//! For example:
//! ```
//! use tracing::{event, span, Level};
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! // records an event outside of any span context:
//! event!(Level::INFO, "something happened");
//!
//! let span = span!(Level::INFO, "my_span");
//! let _guard = span.enter();
//!
//! // records an event within "my_span".
//! event!(Level::DEBUG, "something happened inside my_span");
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! In general, events should be used to represent points in time _within_ a
//! span — a request returned with a given status code, _n_ new items were
//! taken from a queue, and so on.
//!
//! The [`Event` struct][`Event`] documentation provides further details on using
//! events.
//!
//! ## Subscribers
//!
//! As `Span`s and `Event`s occur, they are recorded or aggregated by
//! implementations of the [`Subscriber`] trait. `Subscriber`s are notified
//! when an `Event` takes place and when a `Span` is entered or exited. These
//! notifications are represented by the following `Subscriber` trait methods:
//!
//! + [`event`][Subscriber::event], called when an `Event` takes place,
//! + [`enter`], called when execution enters a `Span`,
//! + [`exit`], called when execution exits a `Span`
//!
//! In addition, subscribers may implement the [`enabled`] function to _filter_
//! the notifications they receive based on [metadata] describing each `Span`
//! or `Event`. If a call to `Subscriber::enabled` returns `false` for a given
//! set of metadata, that `Subscriber` will *not* be notified about the
//! corresponding `Span` or `Event`. For performance reasons, if no currently
//! active subscribers express interest in a given set of metadata by returning
//! `true`, then the corresponding `Span` or `Event` will never be constructed.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! tracing = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! *Compiler support: requires rustc 1.39+*
//!
//! ## Recording Spans and Events
//!
//! Spans and events are recorded using macros.
//!
//! ### Spans
//!
//! The [`span!`] macro expands to a [`Span` struct][`Span`] which is used to
//! record a span. The [`Span::enter`] method on that struct records that the
//! span has been entered, and returns a [RAII] guard object, which will exit
//! the span when dropped.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tracing::{span, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! // Construct a new span named "my span" with trace log level.
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my span");
//!
//! // Enter the span, returning a guard object.
//! let _enter = span.enter();
//!
//! // Any trace events that occur before the guard is dropped will occur
//! // within the span.
//!
//! // Dropping the guard will exit the span.
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The [`#[instrument]`][instrument] attribute provides an easy way to
//! add `tracing` spans to functions. A function annotated with `#[instrument]`
//! will create and enter a span with that function's name every time the
//! function is called, with arguments to that function will be recorded as
//! fields using `fmt::Debug`.
//!
//! For example:
//! ```ignore
//! # // this doctest is ignored because we don't have a way to say
//! # // that it should only be run with cfg(feature = "attributes")
//! use tracing::{Level, event, instrument};
//!
//! #[instrument]
//! pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {
//!     // This event will be recorded inside a span named `my_function` with the
//!     // field `my_arg`.
//!     event!(Level::INFO, "inside my_function!");
//!     // ...
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//!
//! You can find more examples showing how to use this crate [here][examples].
//!
//! [RAII]: https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/patterns/RAII.md
//! [examples]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/tree/master/examples
//!
//! ### Events
//!
//! [`Event`]s are recorded using the [`event!`] macro:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # fn main() {
//! use tracing::{event, Level};
//! event!(Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Using the Macros
//!
//! The [`span!`] and [`event!`] macros as well as the `#[instrument]` attribute
//! use fairly similar syntax, with some exceptions.
//!
//! ### Configuring Attributes
//!
//! Both macros require a [`Level`] specifying the verbosity of the span or
//! event. Optionally, the [target] and [parent span] may be overridden. If the
//! target and parent span are not overridden, they will default to the
//! module path where the macro was invoked and the current span (as determined
//! by the subscriber), respectively.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{span, event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! span!(target: "app_spans", Level::TRACE, "my span");
//! event!(target: "app_events", Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
//! # }
//! ```
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{span, event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my span");
//! event!(parent: &span, Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The span macros also take a string literal after the level, to set the name
//! of the span.
//!
//! ### Recording Fields
//!
//! Structured fields on spans and events are specified using the syntax
//! `field_name = field_value`. Fields are separated by commas.
//!
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! // records an event with two fields:
//! //  - "answer", with the value 42
//! //  - "question", with the value "life, the universe and everything"
//! event!(Level::INFO, answer = 42, question = "life, the universe, and everything");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! As shorthand, local variables may be used as field values without an
//! assignment, similar to [struct initializers]. For example:
//!
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{span, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! let user = "ferris";
//!
//! span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user);
//! // is equivalent to:
//! span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user = user);
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! Field names can include dots, but should not be terminated by them:
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{span, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! let user = "ferris";
//! let email = "ferris@rust-lang.org";
//! span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user, user.email = email);
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! Since field names can include dots, fields on local structs can be used
//! using the local variable shorthand:
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{span, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! # struct User {
//! #    name: &'static str,
//! #    email: &'static str,
//! # }
//! let user = User {
//!     name: "ferris",
//!     email: "ferris@rust-lang.org",
//! };
//! // the span will have the fields `user.name = "ferris"` and
//! // `user.email = "ferris@rust-lang.org"`.
//! span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user.name, user.email);
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! Fields with names that are not Rust identifiers, or with names that are Rust reserved words,
//! may be created using quoted string literals. However, this may not be used with the local
//! variable shorthand.
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{span, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! // records an event with fields whose names are not Rust identifiers
//! //  - "guid:x-request-id", containing a `:`, with the value "abcdef"
//! //  - "type", which is a reserved word, with the value "request"
//! span!(Level::TRACE, "api", "guid:x-request-id" = "abcdef", "type" = "request");
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! The `?` sigil is shorthand that specifies a field should be recorded using
//! its [`fmt::Debug`] implementation:
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     field: &'static str,
//! }
//!
//! let my_struct = MyStruct {
//!     field: "Hello world!"
//! };
//!
//! // `my_struct` will be recorded using its `fmt::Debug` implementation.
//! event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = ?my_struct);
//! // is equivalent to:
//! event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = tracing::field::debug(&my_struct));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The `%` sigil operates similarly, but indicates that the value should be
//! recorded using its [`fmt::Display`] implementation:
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! # #[derive(Debug)]
//! # struct MyStruct {
//! #     field: &'static str,
//! # }
//! #
//! # let my_struct = MyStruct {
//! #     field: "Hello world!"
//! # };
//! // `my_struct.field` will be recorded using its `fmt::Display` implementation.
//! event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = %my_struct.field);
//! // is equivalent to:
//! event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = tracing::field::display(&my_struct.field));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The `%` and `?` sigils may also be used with local variable shorthand:
//!
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! # #[derive(Debug)]
//! # struct MyStruct {
//! #     field: &'static str,
//! # }
//! #
//! # let my_struct = MyStruct {
//! #     field: "Hello world!"
//! # };
//! // `my_struct.field` will be recorded using its `fmt::Display` implementation.
//! event!(Level::TRACE, %my_struct.field);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Additionally, a span may declare fields with the special value [`Empty`],
//! which indicates that that the value for that field does not currently exist
//! but may be recorded later. For example:
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing::{trace_span, field};
//!
//! // Create a span with two fields: `greeting`, with the value "hello world", and
//! // `parting`, without a value.
//! let span = trace_span!("my_span", greeting = "hello world", parting = field::Empty);
//!
//! // ...
//!
//! // Now, record a value for parting as well.
//! span.record("parting", &"goodbye world!");
//! ```
//!
//! Note that a span may have up to 32 fields. The following will not compile:
//!
//! ```rust,compile_fail
//! # use tracing::Level;
//! # fn main() {
//! let bad_span = span!(
//!     Level::TRACE,
//!     "too many fields!",
//!     a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5, f = 6, g = 7, h = 8, i = 9,
//!     j = 10, k = 11, l = 12, m = 13, n = 14, o = 15, p = 16, q = 17,
//!     r = 18, s = 19, t = 20, u = 21, v = 22, w = 23, x = 24, y = 25,
//!     z = 26, aa = 27, bb = 28, cc = 29, dd = 30, ee = 31, ff = 32, gg = 33
//! );
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, events may also include human-readable messages, in the form of a
//! [format string][fmt] and (optional) arguments, **after** the event's
//! key-value fields. If a format string and arguments are provided,
//! they will implicitly create a new field named `message` whose value is the
//! provided set of format arguments.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{event, Level};
//! # fn main() {
//! let question = "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything";
//! let answer = 42;
//! // records an event with the following fields:
//! // - `question.answer` with the value 42,
//! // - `question.tricky` with the value `true`,
//! // - "message", with the value "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the
//! //    universe, and everything is 42."
//! event!(
//!     Level::DEBUG,
//!     question.answer = answer,
//!     question.tricky = true,
//!     "the answer to {} is {}.", question, answer
//! );
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Specifying a formatted message in this manner does not allocate by default.

//! ### Shorthand Macros
//!
//! `tracing` also offers a number of macros with preset verbosity levels.
//! The [`trace!`], [`debug!`], [`info!`], [`warn!`], and [`error!`] behave
//! similarly to the [`event!`] macro, but with the [`Level`] argument already
//! specified, while the corresponding [`trace_span!`], [`debug_span!`],
//! [`info_span!`], [`warn_span!`], and [`error_span!`] macros are the same,
//! but for the [`span!`] macro.
//!
//! These are intended both as a shorthand, and for compatibility with the [`log`]
//! crate (see the next section).

//! [`error_span!`]: macro.error_span.html
//! [`Level`]: struct.Level.html
//!
//! ### For `log` Users
//!
//! Users of the [`log`] crate should note that `tracing` exposes a set of
//! macros for creating `Event`s (`trace!`, `debug!`, `info!`, `warn!`, and
//! `error!`) which may be invoked with the same syntax as the similarly-named
//! macros from the `log` crate. Often, the process of converting a project to
//! use `tracing` can begin with a simple drop-in replacement.
//!
//! Let's consider the `log` crate's yak-shaving example:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use std::{error::Error, io};
//! use tracing::{debug, error, info, span, warn, Level};
//!
//! // the `#[tracing::instrument]` attribute creates and enters a span
//! // every time the instrumented function is called. The span is named after the
//! // the function or method. Parameters passed to the function are recorded as fields.
//! #[tracing::instrument]
//! pub fn shave(yak: usize) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error + 'static>> {
//!     // this creates an event at the DEBUG level with two fields:
//!     // - `excitement`, with the key "excitement" and the value "yay!"
//!     // - `message`, with the key "message" and the value "hello! I'm gonna shave a yak."
//!     //
//!     // unlike other fields, `message`'s shorthand initialization is just the string itself.
//!     debug!(excitement = "yay!", "hello! I'm gonna shave a yak.");
//!     if yak == 3 {
//!         warn!("could not locate yak!");
//!         // note that this is intended to demonstrate `tracing`'s features, not idiomatic
//!         // error handling! in a library or application, you should consider returning
//!         // a dedicated `YakError`. libraries like snafu or thiserror make this easy.
//!         return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "shaving yak failed!").into());
//!     } else {
//!         debug!("yak shaved successfully");
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! pub fn shave_all(yaks: usize) -> usize {
//!     // Constructs a new span named "shaving_yaks" at the TRACE level,
//!     // and a field whose key is "yaks". This is equivalent to writing:
//!     //
//!     // let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "shaving_yaks", yaks = yaks);
//!     //
//!     // local variables (`yaks`) can be used as field values
//!     // without an assignment, similar to struct initializers.
//!     let _span = span!(Level::TRACE, "shaving_yaks", yaks).entered();
//!
//!     info!("shaving yaks");
//!
//!     let mut yaks_shaved = 0;
//!     for yak in 1..=yaks {
//!         let res = shave(yak);
//!         debug!(yak, shaved = res.is_ok());
//!
//!         if let Err(ref error) = res {
//!             // Like spans, events can also use the field initialization shorthand.
//!             // In this instance, `yak` is the field being initalized.
//!             error!(yak, error = error.as_ref(), "failed to shave yak!");
//!         } else {
//!             yaks_shaved += 1;
//!         }
//!         debug!(yaks_shaved);
//!     }
//!
//!     yaks_shaved
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## In libraries
//!
//! Libraries should link only to the `tracing` crate, and use the provided
//! macros to record whatever information will be useful to downstream
//! consumers.
//!
//! ## In executables
//!
//! In order to record trace events, executables have to use a `Subscriber`
//! implementation compatible with `tracing`. A `Subscriber` implements a
//! way of collecting trace data, such as by logging it to standard output.
//!
//! This library does not contain any `Subscriber` implementations; these are
//! provided by [other crates](#related-crates).
//!
//! The simplest way to use a subscriber is to call the [`set_global_default`]
//! function:
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate tracing;
//! # pub struct FooSubscriber;
//! # use tracing::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata};
//! # impl tracing::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }
//! #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}
//! #   fn event(&self, _: &tracing::Event) {}
//! #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! # }
//! # impl FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber }
//! # }
//! # fn main() {
//!
//! let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(my_subscriber)
//!     .expect("setting tracing default failed");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! <div class="information">
//!     <div class="tooltip compile_fail" style="">&#x26a0; &#xfe0f;<span class="tooltiptext">Warning</span></div>
//! </div><div class="example-wrap" style="display:inline-block"><pre class="compile_fail" style="white-space:normal;font:inherit;">
//! <strong>Warning</strong>: In general, libraries should <em>not</em> call
//! <code>set_global_default()</code>! Doing so will cause conflicts when
//! executables that depend on the library try to set the default later.
//! </pre></div>
//!
//! This subscriber will be used as the default in all threads for the
//! remainder of the duration of the program, similar to setting the logger
//! in the `log` crate.
//!
//! In addition, the default subscriber can be set through using the
//! [`with_default`] function. This follows the `tokio` pattern of using
//! closures to represent executing code in a context that is exited at the end
//! of the closure. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # pub struct FooSubscriber;
//! # use tracing::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata};
//! # impl tracing::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }
//! #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}
//! #   fn event(&self, _: &tracing::Event) {}
//! #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! # }
//! # impl FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber }
//! # }
//! # fn main() {
//!
//! let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! tracing::subscriber::with_default(my_subscriber, || {
//!     // Any trace events generated in this closure or by functions it calls
//!     // will be collected by `my_subscriber`.
//! })
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This approach allows trace data to be collected by multiple subscribers
//! within different contexts in the program. Note that the override only applies to the
//! currently executing thread; other threads will not see the change from with_default.
//!
//! Any trace events generated outside the context of a subscriber will not be collected.
//!
//! Once a subscriber has been set, instrumentation points may be added to the
//! executable using the `tracing` crate's macros.
//!
//! ## `log` Compatibility
//!
//! The [`log`] crate provides a simple, lightweight logging facade for Rust.
//! While `tracing` builds upon `log`'s foundation with richer structured
//! diagnostic data, `log`'s simplicity and ubiquity make it the "lowest common
//! denominator" for text-based logging in Rust — a vast majority of Rust
//! libraries and applications either emit or consume `log` records. Therefore,
//! `tracing` provides multiple forms of interoperability with `log`: `tracing`
//! instrumentation can emit `log` records, and a compatibility layer enables
//! `tracing` [`Subscriber`]s to consume `log` records as `tracing` [`Event`]s.
//!
//! ### Emitting `log` Records
//!
//! This crate provides two feature flags, "log" and "log-always", which will
//! cause [spans] and [events] to emit `log` records. When the "log" feature is
//! enabled, if no `tracing` `Subscriber` is active, invoking an event macro or
//! creating a span with fields will emit a `log` record. This is intended
//! primarily for use in libraries which wish to emit diagnostics that can be
//! consumed by applications using `tracing` *or* `log`, without paying the
//! additional overhead of emitting both forms of diagnostics when `tracing` is
//! in use.
//!
//! Enabling the "log-always" feature will cause `log` records to be emitted
//! even if a `tracing` `Subscriber` _is_ set. This is intended to be used in
//! applications where a `log` `Logger` is being used to record a textual log,
//! and `tracing` is used only to record other forms of diagnostics (such as
//! metrics, profiling, or distributed tracing data). Unlike the "log" feature,
//! libraries generally should **not** enable the "log-always" feature, as doing
//! so will prevent applications from being able to opt out of the `log` records.
//!
//! See [here][flags] for more details on this crate's feature flags.
//!
//! The generated `log` records' messages will be a string representation of the
//! span or event's fields, and all additional information recorded by `log`
//! (target, verbosity level, module path, file, and line number) will also be
//! populated. Additionally, `log` records are also generated when spans are
//! entered, exited, and closed. Since these additional span lifecycle logs have
//! the potential to be very verbose, and don't include additional fields, they
//! will always be emitted at the `Trace` level, rather than inheriting the
//! level of the span that generated them. Furthermore, they are are categorized
//! under a separate `log` target, "tracing::span" (and its sub-target,
//! "tracing::span::active", for the logs on entering and exiting a span), which
//! may be enabled or disabled separately from other `log` records emitted by
//! `tracing`.
//!
//! ### Consuming `log` Records
//!
//! The [`tracing-log`] crate provides a compatibility layer which
//! allows a `tracing` [`Subscriber`] to consume `log` records as though they
//! were `tracing` [events]. This allows applications using `tracing` to record
//! the logs emitted by dependencies using `log` as events within the context of
//! the application's trace tree. See [that crate's documentation][log-tracer]
//! for details.

//!
//! ## Related Crates
//!
//! In addition to `tracing` and `tracing-core`, the [`tokio-rs/tracing`] repository
//! contains several additional crates designed to be used with the `tracing` ecosystem.
//! This includes a collection of `Subscriber` implementations, as well as utility
//! and adapter crates to assist in writing `Subscriber`s and instrumenting
//! applications.
//!
//! In particular, the following crates are likely to be of interest:
//!
//!  - [`tracing-futures`] provides a compatibility layer with the `futures`
//!    crate, allowing spans to be attached to `Future`s, `Stream`s, and `Executor`s.
//!  - [`tracing-subscriber`] provides `Subscriber` implementations and
//!    utilities for working with `Subscriber`s. This includes a [`FmtSubscriber`]
//!    `FmtSubscriber` for logging formatted trace data to stdout, with similar
//!    filtering and formatting to the [`env_logger`] crate.
//!  - [`tracing-log`] provides a compatibility layer with the [`log`] crate,
//!    allowing log messages to be recorded as `tracing` `Event`s within the
//!    trace tree. This is useful when a project using `tracing` have
//!    dependencies which use `log`. Note that if you're using
//!    `tracing-subscriber`'s `FmtSubscriber`, you don't need to depend on
//!    `tracing-log` directly.
//!  - [`tracing-appender`] provides utilities for outputting tracing data,
//!     including a file appender and non blocking writer.
//!
//! Additionally, there are also several third-party crates which are not
//! maintained by the `tokio` project. These include:
//!
//!  - [`tracing-timing`] implements inter-event timing metrics on top of `tracing`.
//!    It provides a subscriber that records the time elapsed between pairs of
//!    `tracing` events and generates histograms.
//!  - [`tracing-opentelemetry`] provides a subscriber for emitting traces to
//!    [OpenTelemetry]-compatible distributed tracing systems.
//!  - [`tracing-honeycomb`] Provides a layer that reports traces spanning multiple machines to [honeycomb.io]. Backed by [`tracing-distributed`].
//!  - [`tracing-distributed`] Provides a generic implementation of a layer that reports traces spanning multiple machines to some backend.
//!  - [`tracing-actix`] provides `tracing` integration for the `actix` actor
//!    framework.
//!  - [`tracing-gelf`] implements a subscriber for exporting traces in Greylog
//!    GELF format.
//!  - [`tracing-coz`] provides integration with the [coz] causal profiler
//!    (Linux-only).
//!  - [`tracing-bunyan-formatter`] provides a layer implementation that reports events and spans
//!    in [bunyan] format, enriched with timing information.
//!  - [`tracing-wasm`] provides a `Subscriber`/`Layer` implementation that reports
//!    events and spans via browser `console.log` and [User Timing API (`window.performance`)].
//!  - [`tide-tracing`] provides a [tide] middleware to trace all incoming requests and responses.
//!  - [`test-env-log`] takes care of initializing `tracing` for tests, based on
//!    environment variables with an `env_logger` compatible syntax.
//!  - [`tracing-unwrap`] provides convenience methods to report failed unwraps
//!    on `Result` or `Option` types to a `Subscriber`.
//!  - [`diesel-tracing`] provides integration with [`diesel`] database connections.
//!  - [`tracing-tracy`] provides a way to collect [Tracy] profiles in instrumented
//!    applications.
//!  - [`tracing-elastic-apm`] provides a layer for reporting traces to [Elastic APM].
//!

//! please let us know! We'd love to add your project to the list!

//!
//! ## Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate feature flags are available:
//!
//! * A set of features controlling the [static verbosity level].
//! * `log`: causes trace instrumentation points to emit [`log`] records as well
//!   as trace events, if a default `tracing` subscriber has not been set. This
//!   is intended for use in libraries whose users may be using either `tracing`
//!   or `log`.
//! * `log-always`: Emit `log` records from all `tracing` spans and events, even
//!   if a `tracing` subscriber has been set. This should be set only by
//!   applications which intend to collect traces and logs separately; if an
//!   adapter is used to convert `log` records into `tracing` events, this will
//!   cause duplicate events to occur.
//! * `attributes`: Includes support for the `#[instrument]` attribute.
//!   This is on by default, but does bring in the `syn` crate as a dependency,
//!   which may add to the compile time of crates that do not already use it.
//! * `std`: Depend on the Rust standard library (enabled by default).
//!
//!   `no_std` users may disable this feature with `default-features = false`:
//!
//!   ```toml
//!   [dependencies]
//!   tracing = { version = "0.1.25", default-features = false }
//!   ```
//!
//! <div class="information">
//!     <div class="tooltip ignore" style="">ⓘ<span class="tooltiptext">Note</span></div>
//! </div>
//! <div class="example-wrap" style="display:inline-block">
//! <pre class="ignore" style="white-space:normal;font:inherit;">
//! <strong>Note</strong>: <code>tracing</code>'s <code>no_std</code> support
//! requires <code>liballoc</code>.
//! </pre></div>
//!
//! ## Supported Rust Versions
//!
//! Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
//! version is 1.42. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on
//! Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.
//!
//! Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
//! project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
//! versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current
//! stable compiler version is 1.45, the minimum supported version will not be
//! increased past 1.42, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum
//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as
//! long as doing so complies with this policy.
