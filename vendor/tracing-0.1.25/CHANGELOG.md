# 0.1.18 (July 31, 2020)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `LevelFilter::OFF` (and thus also the `static_max_level_off`
  feature flag) would enable *all* traces, rather than *none* (#853)
- **log**: Fixed `tracing` macros and `Span`s not checking `log::max_level`
  before emitting `log` records (#870)
  
### Changed

- **macros**: Macros now check the global max level (`LevelFilter::current`)
  before the per-callsite cache when determining if a span or event is enabled.
  This significantly improves performance in some use cases (#853)
- **macros**: Simplified the code generated by macro expansion significantly,
  which may improve compile times and/or `rustc` optimizatation of surrounding
  code (#869, #869)
- **macros**: Macros now check the static max level before checking any runtime
  filtering, improving performance when a span or event is disabled by a
  `static_max_level_XXX` feature flag (#868) 
- `LevelFilter` is now a re-export of the `tracing_core::LevelFilter` type, it
  can now be used interchangably with the versions in `tracing-core` and
  `tracing-subscriber` (#853)
- Significant performance improvements when comparing `LevelFilter`s and
  `Level`s (#853)
- Updated the minimum `tracing-core` dependency to 0.1.12 (#853)

### Added

- **macros**: Quoted string literals may now be used as field names, to allow
  fields whose names are not valid Rust identifiers (#790)
- **docs**: Several documentation improvements (#850, #857, #841)
- `LevelFilter::current()` function, which returns the highest level that any
  subscriber will enable (#853)
- `Subscriber::max_level_hint` optional trait method, for setting the value
  returned by `LevelFilter::current()` (#853)

@colelawrence, and @rbtcollins for helping out with this release!

# 0.1.17 (July 22, 2020)

### Changed

- **log**: Moved verbose span enter/exit log records to "tracing::span::active"
  target, allowing them to be filtered separately (#833)
- **log**: All span lifecycle log records without fields now have the `Trace`
  log filter, to guard against `log` users enabling them by default with blanket
  level filtering (#833)
  
### Fixed

- **log**/**macros**: Fixed missing implicit imports of the
  `tracing::field::debug` and `tracing::field::display` functions inside the
  macros when the "log" feature is enabled (#835)

# 0.1.16 (July 8, 2020)

### Added

  input (#672, #786)
- Improved documentation on using `tracing` in async code (#769)

### Changed

- Updated `tracing-core` dependency to 0.1.11

### Fixed

- **macros**: Excessive monomorphization in macros, which could lead to
  longer compilation times (#787) 
- **log**: Compiler warnings in macros when `log` or `log-always` features
  are enabled (#753)
- Compiler error when `tracing-core/std` feature is enabled but `tracing/std` is
  not (#760)

Thanks to @nagisa for contributing to this release!

# 0.1.14 (May 14, 2020)

### Added

- **log**: When using the [`log`] compatibility feature alongside a `tracing`
  `Subscriber`, log records for spans now include span IDs (#613)
- **attributes**: Support for using `#[instrument]` on methods that are part of
  [`async-trait`] trait implementations (#711)
- **attributes**: Optional `#[instrument(err)]` argument to automatically emit
  an event if an instrumented function returns `Err` (#637) 
- Added `#[must_use]` attribute to the guard returned by
  `subscriber::set_default` (#685)
  
### Changed
