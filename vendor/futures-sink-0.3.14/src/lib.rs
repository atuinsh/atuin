/// A `Sink` is a value into which other values can be sent, asynchronously.
///
/// Basic examples of sinks include the sending side of:
///
/// - Channels
/// - Sockets
/// - Pipes
///
/// In addition to such "primitive" sinks, it's typical to layer additional
/// functionality, such as buffering, on top of an existing sink.
///
/// Sending to a sink is "asynchronous" in the sense that the value may not be
/// sent in its entirety immediately. Instead, values are sent in a two-phase
/// way: first by initiating a send, and then by polling for completion. This
/// two-phase setup is analogous to buffered writing in synchronous code, where
/// writes often succeed immediately, but internally are buffered and are
/// *actually* written only upon flushing.
///
/// In addition, the `Sink` may be *full*, in which case it is not even possible
/// to start the sending process.
///
/// As with `Future` and `Stream`, the `Sink` trait is built from a few core
/// required methods, and a host of default methods for working in a
/// higher-level way. The `Sink::send_all` combinator is of particular
/// importance: you can use it to send an entire stream to a sink, which is
/// the simplest way to ultimately consume a stream.
