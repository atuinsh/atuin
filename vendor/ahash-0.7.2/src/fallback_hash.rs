    /// to attack. The attack was based on the idea of reversing the pre-mixing (Which is necessarily
    /// reversible otherwise bits would be lost) then placing a difference in the highest bit before the
    /// multiply used to mix the data. Because a multiply can never affect the bits to the right of it, a
    /// subsequent update that also differed in this bit could result in a predictable collision.
    ///
    /// This version avoids this vulnerability while still only using a single multiply. It takes advantage
    /// of the fact that when a 64 bit multiply is performed the upper 64 bits are usually computed and thrown
    /// away. Instead it creates two 128 bit values where the upper 64 bits are zeros and multiplies them.
    /// (The compiler is smart enough to turn this into a 64 bit multiplication in the assembly)
    /// Then the upper bits are xored with the lower bits to produce a single 64 bit result.
    ///
    /// To understand why this is a good scrambling function it helps to understand multiply-with-carry PRNGs:
    /// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply-with-carry_pseudorandom_number_generator
    /// If the multiple is chosen well, this creates a long period, decent quality PRNG.
    /// Notice that this function is equivalent to this except the `buffer`/`state` is being xored with each
    /// new block of data. In the event that data is all zeros, it is exactly equivalent to a MWC PRNG.
    ///
    /// This is impervious to attack because every bit buffer at the end is dependent on every bit in
    /// `new_data ^ buffer`. For example suppose two inputs differed in only the 5th bit. Then when the
    /// multiplication is performed the `result` will differ in bits 5-69. More specifically it will differ by
    /// 2^5 * MULTIPLE. However in the next step bits 65-128 are turned into a separate 64 bit value. So the
    /// differing bits will be in the lower 6 bits of this value. The two intermediate values that differ in
    /// bits 5-63 and in bits 0-5 respectively get added together. Producing an output that differs in every
    /// bit. The addition carries in the multiplication and at the end additionally mean that the even if an
