/// A type of futures-powered synchronization primitive which is a mutex between
/// two possible owners.
///
/// This primitive is not as generic as a full-blown mutex but is sufficient for
/// many use cases where there are only two possible owners of a resource. The
/// implementation of `BiLock` can be more optimized for just the two possible
/// owners.
///
/// Note that it's possible to use this lock through a poll-style interface with
/// the `poll_lock` method but you can also use it as a future with the `lock`
/// method that consumes a `BiLock` and returns a future that will resolve when
/// it's locked.
///
/// A `BiLock` is typically used for "split" operations where data which serves
/// two purposes wants to be split into two to be worked with separately. For
/// example a TCP stream could be both a reader and a writer or a framing layer
/// could be both a stream and a sink for messages. A `BiLock` enables splitting
/// these two and then using each independently in a futures-powered fashion.
///
/// This type is only available when the `bilock` feature of this
/// library is activated.
