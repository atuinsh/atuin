  would assume that `SocketAddrV{4,6}` had the same layout as
  `libc::sockaddr_in(6)`, however this is not guaranteed by the standard
  library.
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/152e0751f0be1c9b0cbd6778645b76bcb0eba93c).

## Reduced support for 32-bit Apple targets

In January 2020 Rust reduced its support for 32-bit Apple targets
(https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/01/03/reducing-support-for-32-bit-apple-targets.html).
Starting with v0.7.1 Mio will do the same as we're no longer checking 32 bit
iOS/macOS on our CI.

## Added

* Support for illumos
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/976f2354d0e8fbbb64fba3bf017d7131f9c369a0).
* Report `epoll(2)`'s `EPOLLERR` event as `Event::is_write_closed` if it's the
  only event
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/0c77b5712d675eeb9bd43928b5dd7d22b2c7ac0c).
* Optimised event::Iter::{size_hint, count}

  ~30 minutes effectively infinite
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/d555991f5ee81f6c1eec0fe481557d3d5b8d5ff4).
* Set `SO_NOSIGPIPE` on all sockets (not just UDP) on for Apple targets
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/b8bbdcb0d3236f4c4acb257996d42a88dc9987d9).
* Properly handle `POLL_ABORT` on Windows
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/a98da62b3ed1eeed1770aaca12f46d647e4fa749).
* Improved error handling around failing `SIO_BASE_HANDLE` calls on Windows
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/b15fc18458a79ef8a51f73effa92548650f4e5dc).

## Changed

* On NetBSD we now use `accept4(2)`
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/4e306addc7144f2e02a7e8397c220b179a006a19).
* The package uploaded to crates.io should be slightly smaller
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/eef8d3b9500bc0db957cd1ac68ee128ebc68351f).

## Removed

* Dependency on `lazy_static` on Windows
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/57e4c2a8ac153bc7bb87829e22cf0a21e3927e8a).

# 0.7.0

Version 0.7 of Mio contains various major changes compared to version 0.6.
Overall a large number of API changes have been made to reduce the complexity of
the implementation and remove overhead where possible.

Please refer to the [blog post about
0.7-alpha.1](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-12-mio-v0.7-alpha.1/) for additional
information.

## Added

* `Interest` structure that replaces `Ready` in registering event sources.
* `Registry` structure that separates the registering and polling functionality.
* `Waker` structure that allows another thread to wake a thread polling `Poll`.
* Unix Domain Socket (UDS) types: `UnixDatagram`, `UnixListener` and
  `UnixStream`.

## Removed

* All code deprecated in 0.6 was removed in 0.7.
* Support for Fuchsia was removed as the code was unmaintained.
* Support for Bitrig was removed, rustc dropped support for it also.
* `UnixReady` was merged into `Ready`.
* Custom user-space readiness queue was removed, this includes the public
  `Registration` and `SetReadiness` types.
* `PollOpt` was removed and all registrations use edge-triggers. See the upgrade
  guide on how to process event using edge-triggers.
* The network types (types in the `net` module) now support only the same API as
  found in the standard library, various methods on the types were removed.
* `TcpStream` now supports vectored I/O.
* `Poll::poll_interruptible` was removed. Instead `Poll::poll` will now return
  an error if one occurs.
* `From<usize>` is removed from `Token`, the internal field is still public, so
  `Token(my_token)` can still be used.

## Changed

* Various documentation improvements were made around correct usage of `Poll`
  and registered event sources. It is recommended to reread the documentation of
  at least `event::Source` and `Poll`.
* Mio now uses Rust 2018 and rustfmt for all code.
* `Event` was changed to be a wrapper around the OS event. This means it can be
  significantly larger on some OSes.
* `Ready` was removed and replaced with various `is_*` methods on `Event`. For
  example instead checking for readable readiness using
  `Event::ready().is_readable()`, you would call `Event::is_readable()`.
* `Ready::is_hup` was removed in favour of `Event::is_read_closed` and
  `Event::is_write_closed`.
* The Iterator implementation of `Events` was changed to return `&Event`.
* `Evented` was renamed to `event::Source` and now takes mutable reference to
  the source.
* Minimum supported Rust version was increased to 1.39.
* By default Mio now uses a shim implementation. To enable the full
  implementation, that uses the OS, enable the `os-oll` feature. To enable the
  network types use `tcp`, `udp` and/or `uds`. For more documentation on the
  features see the `feature` module in the API documentation (requires the
  `extra-docs` feature).
* The entire Windows implementation was rewritten.
* Various optimisation were made to reduce the number of system calls in
  creating and using sockets, e.g. making use of `accept4(2)`.
* The `fmt::Debug` implementation of `Events` is now actually useful as it
  prints all `Event`s.
