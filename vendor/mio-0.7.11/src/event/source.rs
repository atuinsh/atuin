/// An event source that may be registered with [`Registry`].

/// Types that implement `event::Source` can be registered with
/// `Registry`. Users of Mio **should not** use the `event::Source` trait
/// functions directly. Instead, the equivalent functions on `Registry` should
/// be used.
///
/// See [`Registry`] for more details.
///
/// [`Registry`]: ../struct.Registry.html
///
/// # Implementing `event::Source`
///
/// Event sources are always backed by system handles, such as sockets or other
/// system handles. These `event::Source`s will be monitored by the system
/// selector. An implementation of `Source` will almost always delegates to a
/// lower level handle. Examples of this are [`TcpStream`]s, or the *unix only*
/// [`SourceFd`].
///
/// [`TcpStream`]: ../net/struct.TcpStream.html
/// [`SourceFd`]: ../unix/struct.SourceFd.html
///
/// # Dropping `event::Source`s
///
/// All `event::Source`s, unless otherwise specified, need to be [deregistered]
/// before being dropped for them to not leak resources. This goes against the
/// normal drop behaviour of types in Rust which cleanup after themselves, e.g.
/// a `File` will close itself. However since deregistering needs access to
/// [`Registry`] this cannot be done while being dropped.
///
/// [deregistered]: ../struct.Registry.html#method.deregister
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Implementing `Source` on a struct containing a socket:
///
#[cfg_attr(all(feature = "os-poll", features = "net"), doc = "```")]
#[cfg_attr(not(all(feature = "os-poll", features = "net")), doc = "```ignore")]
