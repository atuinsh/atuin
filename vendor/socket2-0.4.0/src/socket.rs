/// Owned wrapper around a system socket.
///
/// This type simply wraps an instance of a file descriptor (`c_int`) on Unix
/// and an instance of `SOCKET` on Windows. This is the main type exported by
/// this crate and is intended to mirror the raw semantics of sockets on
/// platforms as closely as possible. Almost all methods correspond to
/// precisely one libc or OS API call which is essentially just a "Rustic
/// translation" of what's below.
///
/// This type can be freely converted into the network primitives provided by
/// the standard library, such as [`TcpStream`] or [`UdpSocket`], using the
/// [`Into`] trait, see the example below.
///
/// [`TcpStream`]: std::net::TcpStream
/// [`UdpSocket`]: std::net::UdpSocket
///
/// # Notes
///
/// Some methods that set options on `Socket` require two system calls to set
/// there options without overwriting previously set options. We do this by
/// first getting the current settings, applying the desired changes and than
/// updating the settings. This means that the operation is **not** atomic. This
/// can lead to a data race when two threads are changing options in parallel.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```no_run
/// # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
/// use std::net::{SocketAddr, TcpListener};
/// use socket2::{Socket, Domain, Type};
///
/// // create a TCP listener bound to two addresses
/// let socket = Socket::new(Domain::IPV4, Type::STREAM, None)?;
///
/// let address: SocketAddr = "[::1]:12345".parse().unwrap();
/// let address = address.into();
/// socket.bind(&address)?;
/// socket.bind(&address)?;
/// socket.listen(128)?;
///
/// let listener: TcpListener = socket.into();
/// // ...
/// # drop(listener);
/// # Ok(()) }
