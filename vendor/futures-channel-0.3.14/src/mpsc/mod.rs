//! A multi-producer, single-consumer queue for sending values across
//! asynchronous tasks.
//!
//! Similarly to the `std`, channel creation provides [`Receiver`] and
//! [`Sender`] handles. [`Receiver`] implements [`Stream`] and allows a task to
//! read values out of the channel. If there is no message to read from the
//! channel, the current task will be notified when a new value is sent.
//! [`Sender`] implements the `Sink` trait and allows a task to send messages into
//! the channel. If the channel is at capacity, the send will be rejected and
//! the task will be notified when additional capacity is available. In other
//! words, the channel provides backpressure.
//!
//! Unbounded channels are also available using the `unbounded` constructor.
//!
//! # Disconnection
//!
//! When all [`Sender`] handles have been dropped, it is no longer
//! possible to send values into the channel. This is considered the termination
//! event of the stream. As such, [`Receiver::poll_next`]
//! will return `Ok(Ready(None))`.
//!
//! If the [`Receiver`] handle is dropped, then messages can no longer
//! be read out of the channel. In this case, all further attempts to send will
//! result in an error.
//!
//! # Clean Shutdown
//!
//! If the [`Receiver`] is simply dropped, then it is possible for
//! there to be messages still in the channel that will not be processed. As
//! such, it is usually desirable to perform a "clean" shutdown. To do this, the
//! receiver will first call `close`, which will prevent any further messages to
//! be sent into the channel. Then, the receiver consumes the channel to
//! completion, at which point the receiver can be dropped.
//!

// At the core, the channel uses an atomic FIFO queue for message passing. This
// queue is used as the primary coordination primitive. In order to enforce
// capacity limits and handle back pressure, a secondary FIFO queue is used to
// send parked task handles.
//
// The general idea is that the channel is created with a `buffer` size of `n`.
// The channel capacity is `n + num-senders`. Each sender gets one "guaranteed"
// slot to hold a message. This allows `Sender` to know for a fact that a send
// will succeed *before* starting to do the actual work of sending the value.
// Since most of this work is lock-free, once the work starts, it is impossible
// to safely revert.
//
// If the sender is unable to process a send operation, then the current
// task is parked and the handle is sent on the parked task queue.
//
// Note that the implementation guarantees that the channel capacity will never
// exceed the configured limit, however there is no *strict* guarantee that the
// receiver will wake up a parked task *immediately* when a slot becomes
// available. However, it will almost always unpark a task when a slot becomes
// available and it is *guaranteed* that a sender will be unparked when the
// message that caused the sender to become parked is read out of the channel.
//
// The steps for sending a message are roughly:
//
// 1) Increment the channel message count
// 2) If the channel is at capacity, push the task handle onto the wait queue
// 3) Push the message onto the message queue.
//
// The steps for receiving a message are roughly:
//
// 1) Pop a message from the message queue
// 2) Pop a task handle from the wait queue
// 3) Decrement the channel message count.
//
// It's important for the order of operations on lock-free structures to happen
// in reverse order between the sender and receiver. This makes the message
// queue the primary coordination structure and establishes the necessary
// happens-before semantics required for the acquire / release semantics used
// by the queue structure.
