# Release 0.1.42 (2020-10-29)

- [The "i128" feature now bypasses compiler probing][20]. The build script
  used to probe anyway and panic if requested support wasn't found, but
  sometimes this ran into bad corner cases with `autocfg`.

# Release 0.1.37 (2018-05-11)

- [Support for 128-bit integers is now automatically detected and enabled.][5]
  Setting the `i128` crate feature now causes the build script to panic if such
  support is not detected.

# Release 0.1.36 (2018-05-10)

- [The iterators are now implemented for `i128` and `u128`][7] starting with
  Rust 1.26, enabled by the new `i128` crate feature.

# Release 0.1.35 (2018-02-06)

- [num-iter now has its own source repository][num-356] at [rust-num/num-iter][home].
- [There is now a `std` feature][2], enabled by default, along with the implication
  that building *without* this feature makes this a `#[no_std]` crate.
  - There is no difference in the API at this time.
