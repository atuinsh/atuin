//! HTTP header types
//!
//! The module provides [`HeaderName`], [`HeaderMap`], and a number of types
//! used for interacting with `HeaderMap`. These types allow representing both
//! HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 headers.
//!
//! # `HeaderName`
//!
//! The `HeaderName` type represents both standard header names as well as
//! custom header names. The type handles the case insensitive nature of header
//! names and is used as the key portion of `HeaderMap`. Header names are
//! normalized to lower case. In other words, when creating a `HeaderName` with
//! a string, even if upper case characters are included, when getting a string
//! representation of the `HeaderName`, it will be all lower case. This allows
//! for faster `HeaderMap` comparison operations.
//!
//! The internal representation is optimized to efficiently handle the cases
//! most commonly encountered when working with HTTP. Standard header names are
//! special cased and are represented internally as an enum. Short custom
//! headers will be stored directly in the `HeaderName` struct and will not
//! incur any allocation overhead, however longer strings will require an
//! allocation for storage.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! `HeaderName` has a max length of 32,768 for header names. Attempting to
//! parse longer names will result in a panic.
//!
//! # `HeaderMap`
//!
//! `HeaderMap` is a map structure of header names highly optimized for use
//! cases common with HTTP. It is a [multimap] structure, where each header name
//! may have multiple associated header values. Given this, some of the APIs
//! diverge from [`HashMap`].
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Just like `HashMap` in Rust's stdlib, `HeaderMap` is based on [Robin Hood
//! hashing]. This algorithm tends to reduce the worst case search times in the
//! table and enables high load factors without seriously affecting performance.
//! Internally, keys and values are stored in vectors. As such, each insertion
//! will not incur allocation overhead. However, once the underlying vector
//! storage is full, a larger vector must be allocated and all values copied.
//!
//! ## Deterministic ordering
//!
//! Unlike Rust's `HashMap`, values in `HeaderMap` are deterministically
//! ordered. Roughly, values are ordered by insertion. This means that a
//! function that deterministically operates on a header map can rely on the
//! iteration order to remain consistent across processes and platforms.
//!
//! ## Adaptive hashing
//!
//! `HeaderMap` uses an adaptive hashing strategy in order to efficiently handle
//! most common cases. All standard headers have statically computed hash values
//! which removes the need to perform any hashing of these headers at runtime.
//! The default hash function emphasizes performance over robustness. However,
//! `HeaderMap` detects high collision rates and switches to a secure hash
//! function in those events. The threshold is set such that only denial of
//! service attacks should trigger it.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! `HeaderMap` can store a maximum of 32,768 headers (header name / value
//! pairs). Attempting to insert more will result in a panic.
