# Release 0.2.3 (2020-01-09)

- [`Ratio` now performs earlier reductions to avoid overflow with `+-*/%` operators][42].

# Release 0.2.2 (2019-06-10)

- [`Ratio` now implements `Zero::set_zero` and `One::set_one`][47].

# Release 0.2.1 (2018-06-22)

- Maintenance release to fix `html_root_url`.

# Release 0.2.0 (2018-06-19)

### Enhancements

- [`Ratio` now implements `One::is_one` and the `Inv` trait][19].
- [`Ratio` now implements `Sum` and `Product`][25].
- [`Ratio` now supports `i128` and `u128` components][29] with Rust 1.26+.
- [`Ratio` now implements the `Pow` trait][21].

### Breaking Changes

- [`num-rational` now requires rustc 1.15 or greater][18].
- [There is now a `std` feature][23], enabled by default, along with the
  implication that building *without* this feature makes this a `#![no_std]`
  crate.  A few methods now require `FloatCore` instead of `Float`.
- [The `serde` dependency has been updated to 1.0][24], and `rustc-serialize`
  is no longer supported by `num-rational`.
- The optional `num-bigint` dependency has been updated to 0.2, and should be
  enabled using the `bigint-std` feature.  In the future, it may be possible
  to use the `bigint` feature with `no_std`.

# Release 0.1.42 (2018-02-08)

- Maintenance release to update dependencies.


# Release 0.1.41 (2018-01-26)

- [num-rational now has its own source repository][num-356] at [rust-num/num-rational][home].
- [`Ratio` now implements `CheckedAdd`, `CheckedSub`, `CheckedMul`, and `CheckedDiv`][11].
- [`Ratio` now implements `AddAssign`, `SubAssign`, `MulAssign`, `DivAssign`, and `RemAssign`][12]
  with either `Ratio` or an integer on the right side.  The non-assignment operators now also
  accept integers as an operand.
- [`Ratio` operators now make fewer `clone()` calls][14].
