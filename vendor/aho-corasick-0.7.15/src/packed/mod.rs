/*!
A lower level API for packed multiple substring search, principally for a small
number of patterns.

This sub-module provides vectorized routines for quickly finding matches of a
small number of patterns. In general, users of this crate shouldn't need to
interface with this module directory, as the primary
[`AhoCorasick`](../struct.AhoCorasick.html)
searcher will use these routines automatically as a prefilter when applicable.
However, in some cases, callers may want to bypass the Aho-Corasick machinery
entirely and use this vectorized searcher directly.

# Overview

The primary types in this sub-module are:

* [`Searcher`](struct.Searcher.html) executes the actual search algorithm to
  report matches in a haystack.
* [`Builder`](struct.Builder.html) accumulates patterns incrementally and can
  construct a `Searcher`.
* [`Config`](struct.Config.html) permits tuning the searcher, and itself will
  produce a `Builder` (which can then be used to build a `Searcher`).
  Currently, the only tuneable knob are the match semantics, but this may be
  expanded in the future.

# Examples

This example shows how to create a searcher from an iterator of patterns.
By default, leftmost-first match semantics are used. (See the top-level
[`MatchKind`](../enum.MatchKind.html) type for more details about match
semantics, which apply similarly to packed substring search.)

```
use aho_corasick::packed::{MatchKind, Searcher};

# fn example() -> Option<()> {
let searcher = Searcher::new(["foobar", "foo"].iter().cloned())?;
let matches: Vec<usize> = searcher
    .find_iter("foobar")
    .map(|mat| mat.pattern())
    .collect();
assert_eq!(vec![0], matches);
# Some(()) }
# if cfg!(target_arch = "x86_64") {
#     example().unwrap()
# } else {
#     assert!(example().is_none());
# }
```

This example shows how to use [`Config`](struct.Config.html) to change the
match semantics to leftmost-longest:

```
use aho_corasick::packed::{Config, MatchKind};

# fn example() -> Option<()> {
let searcher = Config::new()
    .match_kind(MatchKind::LeftmostLongest)
    .builder()
    .add("foo")
    .add("foobar")
    .build()?;
let matches: Vec<usize> = searcher
    .find_iter("foobar")
    .map(|mat| mat.pattern())
    .collect();
assert_eq!(vec![1], matches);
# Some(()) }
# if cfg!(target_arch = "x86_64") {
#     example().unwrap()
# } else {
#     assert!(example().is_none());
# }
```

# Packed substring searching

Packed substring searching refers to the use of SIMD (Single Instruction,
Multiple Data) to accelerate the detection of matches in a haystack. Unlike
conventional algorithms, such as Aho-Corasick, SIMD algorithms for substring
search tend to do better with a small number of patterns, where as Aho-Corasick
generally maintains reasonably consistent performance regardless of the number
of patterns you give it. Because of this, the vectorized searcher in this
sub-module cannot be used as a general purpose searcher, since building the
searcher may fail. However, in exchange, when searching for a small number of
patterns, searching can be quite a bit faster than Aho-Corasick (sometimes by
an order of magnitude).

The key take away here is that constructing a searcher from a list of patterns
is a fallible operation. While the precise conditions under which building a
searcher can fail is specifically an implementation detail, here are some
common reasons:

* Too many patterns were given. Typically, the limit is on the order of 100 or
  so, but this limit may fluctuate based on available CPU features.
* The available packed algorithms require CPU features that aren't available.
  For example, currently, this crate only provides packed algorithms for
  `x86_64`. Therefore, constructing a packed searcher on any other target
  (e.g., ARM) will always fail.
* Zero patterns were given, or one of the patterns given was empty. Packed
  searchers require at least one pattern and that all patterns are non-empty.
* Something else about the nature of the patterns (typically based on
  heuristics) suggests that a packed searcher would perform very poorly, so
  no searcher is built.
