//! A UTF-8 encoded, growable string.
//!
//! This module contains the [`String`] type and several error types that may
//! result from working with [`String`]s.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! You can create a new [`String`] from a string literal with [`String::from_str_in`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//!
//! let s = String::from_str_in("world", &b);
//! ```
//!
//! You can create a new [`String`] from an existing one by concatenating with
//! `+`:
//!
//! [`String`]: struct.String.html
//! [`String::from_str_in`]: struct.String.html#method.from_str_in
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
//!
//! let s = "Hello".to_string();
//!
//! let message = s + " world!";
//! ```
//!
//! If you have a vector of valid UTF-8 bytes, you can make a [`String`] out of
//! it. You can do the reverse too.
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//!
//! let sparkle_heart = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 240, 159, 146, 150];
//!
//! // We know these bytes are valid, so we'll use `unwrap()`.
//! let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!("💖", sparkle_heart);
//!
//! let bytes = sparkle_heart.into_bytes();
//!
//! assert_eq!(bytes, [240, 159, 146, 150]);

///
/// [`str`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// You can create a `String` from a literal string with [`String::from_iter_in`]:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let hello = String::from_str_in("Hello, world!", &b);
/// ```
///
/// You can append a [`char`] to a `String` with the [`push`] method, and

///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let mut hello = String::from_str_in("Hello, ", &b);
///
/// hello.push('w');
/// hello.push_str("orld!");
/// ```
///
/// [`String::from_iter_in`]: #method.from_iter_in
/// [`char`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.char.html
/// [`push`]: #method.push
/// [`push_str`]: #method.push_str
///
/// If you have a vector of UTF-8 bytes, you can create a `String` from it with
/// the [`from_utf8`] method:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();

/// // We know these bytes are valid, so we'll use `unwrap()`.
/// let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).unwrap();
///
/// assert_eq!("💖", sparkle_heart);
/// ```
///
/// [`from_utf8`]: #method.from_utf8
///
/// # UTF-8
///
/// `String`s are always valid UTF-8. This has a few implications, the first of
/// which is that if you need a non-UTF-8 string, consider [`OsString`]. It is
/// similar, but without the UTF-8 constraint. The second implication is that
/// you cannot index into a `String`:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0277
/// let s = "hello";
///
/// println!("The first letter of s is {}", s[0]); // ERROR!!!
/// ```
///
/// [`OsString`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.OsString.html
///
/// Indexing is intended to be a constant-time operation, but UTF-8 encoding
/// does not allow us to do this. Furthermore, it's not clear what sort of
/// thing the index should return: a byte, a codepoint, or a grapheme cluster.
/// The [`bytes`] and [`chars`] methods return iterators over the first
/// two, respectively.
///
/// [`bytes`]: #method.bytes
/// [`chars`]: #method.chars
///
/// # Deref
///
/// `String`s implement [`Deref`]`<Target=str>`, and so inherit all of [`str`]'s
/// methods. In addition, this means that you can pass a `String` to a
/// function which takes a [`&str`] by using an ampersand (`&`):
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// fn takes_str(s: &str) { }
///
/// let s = String::from_str_in("Hello", &b);
///
/// takes_str(&s);
/// ```
///
/// This will create a [`&str`] from the `String` and pass it in. This
/// conversion is very inexpensive, and so generally, functions will accept
/// [`&str`]s as arguments unless they need a `String` for some specific
/// reason.
///
/// In certain cases Rust doesn't have enough information to make this
/// conversion, known as [`Deref`] coercion. In the following example a string
/// slice [`&'a str`][`&str`] implements the trait `TraitExample`, and the function
/// `example_func` takes anything that implements the trait. In this case Rust
/// would need to make two implicit conversions, which Rust doesn't have the
/// means to do. For that reason, the following example will not compile.
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0277
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// trait TraitExample {}
///
/// impl<'a> TraitExample for &'a str {}
///
/// fn example_func<A: TraitExample>(example_arg: A) {}
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
/// let example_string = String::from_str_in("example_string", &b);
/// example_func(&example_string);
/// ```
///
/// There are two options that would work instead. The first would be to
/// change the line `example_func(&example_string);` to
/// `example_func(example_string.as_str());`, using the method [`as_str()`]
/// to explicitly extract the string slice containing the string. The second
/// way changes `example_func(&example_string);` to
/// `example_func(&*example_string);`. In this case we are dereferencing a
/// `String` to a [`str`][`&str`], then referencing the [`str`][`&str`] back to
/// [`&str`]. The second way is more idiomatic, however both work to do the
/// conversion explicitly rather than relying on the implicit conversion.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// A `String` is made up of three components: a pointer to some bytes, a
/// length, and a capacity. The pointer points to an internal buffer `String`
/// uses to store its data. The length is the number of bytes currently stored
/// in the buffer, and the capacity is the size of the buffer in bytes. As such,
/// the length will always be less than or equal to the capacity.
///
/// This buffer is always stored on the heap.
///
/// You can look at these with the [`as_ptr`], [`len`], and [`capacity`]
/// methods:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let story = String::from_str_in("Once upon a time...", &b);
///
/// let ptr = story.as_ptr();
/// let len = story.len();
/// let capacity = story.capacity();
///
/// // story has nineteen bytes
/// assert_eq!(19, len);
///
/// // Now that we have our parts, we throw the story away.
/// mem::forget(story);
///
/// // We can re-build a String out of ptr, len, and capacity. This is all
/// // unsafe because we are responsible for making sure the components are
/// // valid:
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts_in(ptr as *mut _, len, capacity, &b) } ;
///
/// assert_eq!(String::from_str_in("Once upon a time...", &b), s);
/// ```
///
/// [`as_ptr`]: #method.as_ptr
/// [`len`]: #method.len
/// [`capacity`]: #method.capacity
///
/// If a `String` has enough capacity, adding elements to it will not
/// re-allocate. For example, consider this program:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let mut s = String::new_in(&b);
///
/// println!("{}", s.capacity());
///
/// for _ in 0..5 {
///     s.push_str("hello");
///     println!("{}", s.capacity());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will output the following:
///
/// ```text
/// 0
/// 5
/// 10
/// 20
/// 20
/// 40
/// ```
///
/// At first, we have no memory allocated at all, but as we append to the
/// string, it increases its capacity appropriately. If we instead use the
/// [`with_capacity_in`] method to allocate the correct capacity initially:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::String};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let mut s = String::with_capacity_in(25, &b);
///
/// println!("{}", s.capacity());
///
/// for _ in 0..5 {
///     s.push_str("hello");
///     println!("{}", s.capacity());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`with_capacity_in`]: #method.with_capacity_in
///
/// We end up with a different output:
///
/// ```text
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// ```
///
/// Here, there's no need to allocate more memory inside the loop.
