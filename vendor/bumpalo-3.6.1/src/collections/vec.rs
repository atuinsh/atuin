//! A contiguous growable array type with heap-allocated contents, written
//! `Vec<'bump, T>`.
//!
//! Vectors have `O(1)` indexing, amortized `O(1)` push (to the end) and
//! `O(1)` pop (from the end).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! You can explicitly create a [`Vec<'bump, T>`] with [`new`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//! let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new_in(&b);
//! ```
//!
//! ...or by using the [`vec!`] macro:
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//!
//! let v: Vec<i32> = bumpalo::vec![in &b];
//!
//! let v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!
//! let v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 0; 10]; // ten zeroes
//! ```
//!
//! You can [`push`] values onto the end of a vector (which will grow the vector
//! as needed):
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//!
//! let mut v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 1, 2];
//!
//! v.push(3);
//! ```
//!
//! Popping values works in much the same way:
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//!
//! let mut v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 1, 2];
//!
//! let two = v.pop();
//! ```
//!
//! Vectors also support indexing (through the [`Index`] and [`IndexMut`] traits):
//!
//! ```
//! use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
//!
//! let b = Bump::new();
//!
//! let mut v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 1, 2, 3];
//! let three = v[2];
//! v[1] = v[1] + 5;
//! ```

///
/// let b = Bump::new();
/// let v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 1, 2, 3];
/// assert_eq!(v[0], 1);

/// let mut vec = Vec::new_in(&b);

///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let mut vec = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 1, 2, 3];

/// in separate steps, especially when initializing a vector of zeros:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let vec = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 0; 5];
/// assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
///
/// // The following is equivalent, but potentially slower:
/// let mut vec1 = Vec::with_capacity_in(5, &b);
/// vec1.resize(5, 0);
/// ```
///
/// Use a `Vec<'bump, T>` as an efficient stack:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let mut stack = Vec::new_in(&b);
///
/// stack.push(1);
/// stack.push(2);
/// stack.push(3);
///
/// while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
///     // Prints 3, 2, 1
///     println!("{}", top);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Indexing
///
/// The `Vec` type allows to access values by index, because it implements the
/// [`Index`] trait. An example will be more explicit:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 0, 2, 4, 6];
/// println!("{}", v[1]); // it will display '2'
/// ```
///
/// However be careful: if you try to access an index which isn't in the `Vec`,
/// your software will panic! You cannot do this:
///
/// ```should_panic
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 0, 2, 4, 6];
/// println!("{}", v[6]); // it will panic!
/// ```
///
/// In conclusion: always check if the index you want to get really exists
/// before doing it.
///
/// # Slicing
///
/// A `Vec` can be mutable. Slices, on the other hand, are read-only objects.
/// To get a slice, use `&`. Example:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::{Bump, collections::Vec};
///
/// fn read_slice(slice: &[usize]) {
///     // ...
/// }
///
/// let b = Bump::new();
///
/// let v = bumpalo::vec![in &b; 0, 1];
/// read_slice(&v);
///
/// // ... and that's all!
/// // you can also do it like this:
/// let x : &[usize] = &v;
/// ```
///
/// In Rust, it's more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors
/// when you just want to provide a read access. The same goes for [`String`] and
/// [`&str`].
///
/// # Capacity and reallocation
///
/// The capacity of a vector is the amount of space allocated for any future
/// elements that will be added onto the vector. This is not to be confused with
/// the *length* of a vector, which specifies the number of actual elements
/// within the vector. If a vector's length exceeds its capacity, its capacity
/// will automatically be increased, but its elements will have to be
/// reallocated.
///
/// For example, a vector with capacity 10 and length 0 would be an empty vector
/// with space for 10 more elements. Pushing 10 or fewer elements onto the
/// vector will not change its capacity or cause reallocation to occur. However,
/// if the vector's length is increased to 11, it will have to reallocate, which
/// can be slow. For this reason, it is recommended to use [`Vec::with_capacity_in`]
/// whenever possible to specify how big the vector is expected to get.
///
/// # Guarantees
///
/// Due to its incredibly fundamental nature, `Vec` makes a lot of guarantees
/// about its design. This ensures that it's as low-overhead as possible in
/// the general case, and can be correctly manipulated in primitive ways
/// by unsafe code. Note that these guarantees refer to an unqualified `Vec<'bump, T>`.
/// If additional type parameters are added (e.g. to support custom allocators),
/// overriding their defaults may change the behavior.
///
/// Most fundamentally, `Vec` is and always will be a (pointer, capacity, length)
/// triplet. No more, no less. The order of these fields is completely
/// unspecified, and you should use the appropriate methods to modify these.
/// The pointer will never be null, so this type is null-pointer-optimized.
///
/// However, the pointer may not actually point to allocated memory. In particular,
/// if you construct a `Vec` with capacity 0 via [`Vec::new_in`], [`bumpalo::vec![in bump]`][`vec!`],
/// [`Vec::with_capacity_in(0)`][`Vec::with_capacity_in`], or by calling [`shrink_to_fit`]
/// on an empty Vec, it will not allocate memory. Similarly, if you store zero-sized
/// types inside a `Vec`, it will not allocate space for them. *Note that in this case
/// the `Vec` may not report a [`capacity`] of 0*. `Vec` will allocate if and only
/// if [`mem::size_of::<T>`]`() * capacity() > 0`. In general, `Vec`'s allocation
/// details are very subtle &mdash; if you intend to allocate memory using a `Vec`
/// and use it for something else (either to pass to unsafe code, or to build your
/// own memory-backed collection), be sure to deallocate this memory by using
/// `from_raw_parts` to recover the `Vec` and then dropping it.
///
/// If a `Vec` *has* allocated memory, then the memory it points to is on the heap
/// (as defined by the allocator Rust is configured to use by default), and its
/// pointer points to [`len`] initialized, contiguous elements in order (what
/// you would see if you coerced it to a slice), followed by [`capacity`]` -
/// `[`len`] logically uninitialized, contiguous elements.
///
/// `Vec` will never perform a "small optimization" where elements are actually
/// stored on the stack for two reasons:
///
/// * It would make it more difficult for unsafe code to correctly manipulate
///   a `Vec`. The contents of a `Vec` wouldn't have a stable address if it were
///   only moved, and it would be more difficult to determine if a `Vec` had
///   actually allocated memory.
///
/// * It would penalize the general case, incurring an additional branch
///   on every access.
///
/// `Vec` will never automatically shrink itself, even if completely empty. This
/// ensures no unnecessary allocations or deallocations occur. Emptying a `Vec`
/// and then filling it back up to the same [`len`] should incur no calls to
/// the allocator. If you wish to free up unused memory, use
/// [`shrink_to_fit`][`shrink_to_fit`].
///
/// [`push`] and [`insert`] will never (re)allocate if the reported capacity is
/// sufficient. [`push`] and [`insert`] *will* (re)allocate if
/// [`len`]` == `[`capacity`]. That is, the reported capacity is completely
/// accurate, and can be relied on. It can even be used to manually free the memory
/// allocated by a `Vec` if desired. Bulk insertion methods *may* reallocate, even
/// when not necessary.
///
/// `Vec` does not guarantee any particular growth strategy when reallocating
/// when full, nor when [`reserve`] is called. The current strategy is basic
/// and it may prove desirable to use a non-constant growth factor. Whatever
/// strategy is used will of course guarantee `O(1)` amortized [`push`].
///
/// `bumpalo::vec![in bump; x; n]`, `bumpalo::vec![in bump; a, b, c, d]`, and
/// [`Vec::with_capacity_in(n)`][`Vec::with_capacity_in`], will all produce a
/// `Vec` with exactly the requested capacity. If [`len`]` == `[`capacity`], (as
/// is the case for the [`vec!`] macro), then a `Vec<'bump, T>` can be converted
/// to and from a [`Box<[T]>`][owned slice] without reallocating or moving the
/// elements.
///
/// `Vec` will not specifically overwrite any data that is removed from it,
/// but also won't specifically preserve it. Its uninitialized memory is
/// scratch space that it may use however it wants. It will generally just do
/// whatever is most efficient or otherwise easy to implement. Do not rely on
/// removed data to be erased for security purposes. Even if you drop a `Vec`, its
/// buffer may simply be reused by another `Vec`. Even if you zero a `Vec`'s memory
/// first, that may not actually happen because the optimizer does not consider
/// this a side-effect that must be preserved. There is one case which we will
/// not break, however: using `unsafe` code to write to the excess capacity,
/// and then increasing the length to match, is always valid.
///
/// `Vec` does not currently guarantee the order in which elements are dropped.
/// The order has changed in the past and may change again.
