//! # hyper C API
//!
//! This part of the documentation describes the C API for hyper. That is, how
//! to *use* the hyper library in C code. This is **not** a regular Rust
//! module, and thus it is not accessible in Rust.
//!
//! ## Unstable
//!
//! The C API of hyper is currently **unstable**, which means it's not part of
//! the semver contract as the rest of the Rust API is. Because of that, it's
//! only accessible if `--cfg hyper_unstable_ffi` is passed to `rustc` when
//! compiling. The easiest way to do that is setting the `RUSTFLAGS`
//! environment variable.
//!
//! ## Building
//!
//! The C API is part of the Rust library, but isn't compiled by default. Using
//! `cargo`, it can be compiled with the following command:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg hyper_unstable_ffi" cargo build --features client,http1,http2,ffi
//! ```

// We may eventually allow the FFI to be enabled without `client` or `http1`,
// that is why we don't auto enable them as `ffi = ["client", "http1"]` in
// the `Cargo.toml`.
//
// But for now, give a clear message that this compile error is expected.
#[cfg(not(all(feature = "client", feature = "http1")))]
compile_error!("The `ffi` feature currently requires the `client` and `http1` features.");

#[cfg(not(hyper_unstable_ffi))]
compile_error!(
    "\
    The `ffi` feature is unstable, and requires the \
    `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg hyper_unstable_ffi'` environment variable to be set.\
"
