//! # hyper
//!
//! hyper is a **fast** and **correct** HTTP implementation written in and for Rust.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - HTTP/1 and HTTP/2
//! - Asynchronous design
//! - Leading in performance
//! - Tested and **correct**
//! - Extensive production use
//! - [Client](client/index.html) and [Server](server/index.html) APIs
//!
//! If just starting out, **check out the [Guides](https://hyper.rs/guides)
//! first.**
//!
//! ## "Low-level"
//!
//! hyper is a lower-level HTTP library, meant to be a building block
//! for libraries and applications.
//!
//! If looking for just a convenient HTTP client, consider the
//! [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate.
//!
//! # Optional Features
//!
//! hyper uses a set of [feature flags] to reduce the amount of compiled code.
//! It is possible to just enable certain features over others. By default,
//! hyper does not enable any features but allows one to enable a subset for
//! their use case. Below is a list of the available feature flags. You may
//! also notice above each function, struct and trait there is listed one or
//! more feature flags that are required for that item to be used.
//!
//! If you are new to hyper it is possible to enable the `full` feature flag
//! which will enable all public APIs. Beware though that this will pull in
//! many extra dependencies that you may not need.
//!
//! The following optional features are available:
//!
//! - `http1`: Enables HTTP/1 support.
//! - `http2`: Enables HTTP/2 support.
//! - `client`: Enables the HTTP `client`.
//! - `server`: Enables the HTTP `server`.
//! - `runtime`: Enables convenient integration with `tokio`, providing
//!   connectors and acceptors for TCP, and a default executor.
//! - `tcp`: Enables convenient implementations over TCP (using tokio).
//! - `stream`: Provides `futures::Stream` capabilities.
//!
