//! `tinyvec` provides 100% safe vec-like data structures.
//!
//! ## Provided Types
//! With no features enabled, this crate provides the [`ArrayVec`] type, which
//! is an array-backed storage. You can push values into the array and pop them
//! out of the array and so on. If the array is made to overflow it will panic.
//!
//! Similarly, there is also a [`SliceVec`] type available, which is a vec-like
//! that's backed by a slice you provide. You can add and remove elements, but
//! if you overflow the slice it will panic.
//!
//! With the `alloc` feature enabled, the crate also has a [`TinyVec`] type.
//! This is an enum type which is either an `Inline(ArrayVec)` or a `Heap(Vec)`.
//! If a `TinyVec` is `Inline` and would overflow it automatically transitions
//! itself into being `Heap` mode instead of a panic.
//!
//! All of this is done with no `unsafe` code within the crate. Technically the
//! `Vec` type from the standard library uses `unsafe` internally, but *this
//! crate* introduces no new `unsafe` code into your project.
//!
//! The limitation is that the element type of a vec from this crate must
//! support the [`Default`] trait. This means that this crate isn't suitable for
//! all situations, but a very surprising number of types do support `Default`.
//!
//! ## Other Features
//! * `grab_spare_slice` lets you get access to the "inactive" portions of an
//!   ArrayVec.
//! * `rustc_1_40` makes the crate assume a minimum rust version of `1.40.0`,
//!   which allows some better internal optimizations.
//! * `serde` provides a `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementation for
//!   [`TinyVec`] and [`ArrayVec`] types, provided the inner item also has an
//!   implementation.
//!
//! ## API
//! The general goal of the crate is that, as much as possible, the vecs here
//! should be a "drop in" replacement for the standard library `Vec` type. We
//! strive to provide all of the `Vec` methods with the same names and
//! signatures. The exception is that the element type of some methods will have
//! a `Default` bound that's not part of the normal `Vec` type.
//!
//! The vecs here also have a few additional methods that aren't on the `Vec`
//! type. In this case, the names tend to be fairly long so that they are
//! unlikely to clash with any future methods added to `Vec`.
//!
//! ## Stability
//! * The `1.0` series of the crate works with Rustc `1.34.0` or later, though
//!   you still need to have Rustc `1.36.0` to use the `alloc` feature.
//! * The `2.0` version of the crate is planned for some time after the
//!   `min_const_generics` stuff becomes stable. This would greatly raise the
//!   minimum rust version and also allow us to totally eliminate the need for
//!   the `Array` trait. The actual usage of the crate is not expected to break
//!   significantly in this transition.
