//! Built-in executors and related tools.
//!
//! All asynchronous computation occurs within an executor, which is
//! capable of spawning futures as tasks. This module provides several
//! built-in executors, as well as tools for building your own.
//!
//! All items are only available when the `std` feature of this
//! library is activated, and it is activated by default.
//!
//! # Using a thread pool (M:N task scheduling)
//!
//! Most of the time tasks should be executed on a [thread pool](ThreadPool).
//! A small set of worker threads can handle a very large set of spawned tasks
//! (which are much lighter weight than threads). Tasks spawned onto the pool
//! with the [`spawn_ok`](ThreadPool::spawn_ok) function will run ambiently on
//! the created threads.
//!
//! # Spawning additional tasks
//!
//! Tasks can be spawned onto a spawner by calling its [`spawn_obj`] method
//! directly. In the case of `!Send` futures, [`spawn_local_obj`] can be used
//! instead.
//!
//! # Single-threaded execution
//!
//! In addition to thread pools, it's possible to run a task (and the tasks
//! it spawns) entirely within a single thread via the [`LocalPool`] executor.
//! Aside from cutting down on synchronization costs, this executor also makes
//! it possible to spawn non-`Send` tasks, via [`spawn_local_obj`]. The
//! [`LocalPool`] is best suited for running I/O-bound tasks that do relatively
//! little work between I/O operations.
//!
//! There is also a convenience function [`block_on`] for simply running a
//! future to completion on the current thread.
