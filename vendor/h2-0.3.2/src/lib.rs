//! An asynchronous, HTTP/2.0 server and client implementation.
//!
//! This library implements the [HTTP/2.0] specification. The implementation is
//! asynchronous, using [futures] as the basis for the API. The implementation
//! is also decoupled from TCP or TLS details. The user must handle ALPN and
//! HTTP/1.1 upgrades themselves.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! h2 = "0.3"
//! ```
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! The crate is split into [`client`] and [`server`] modules. Types that are
//! common to both clients and servers are located at the root of the crate.
//!
//! See module level documentation for more details on how to use `h2`.
//!
//! # Handshake
//!
//! Both the client and the server require a connection to already be in a state
//! ready to start the HTTP/2.0 handshake. This library does not provide
//! facilities to do this.
//!
//! There are three ways to reach an appropriate state to start the HTTP/2.0
//! handshake.
//!
//! * Opening an HTTP/1.1 connection and performing an [upgrade].
//! * Opening a connection with TLS and use ALPN to negotiate the protocol.
//! * Open a connection with prior knowledge, i.e. both the client and the
//!   server assume that the connection is immediately ready to start the
//!   HTTP/2.0 handshake once opened.
//!
//! Once the connection is ready to start the HTTP/2.0 handshake, it can be
//! passed to [`server::handshake`] or [`client::handshake`]. At this point, the
//! library will start the handshake process, which consists of:
//!
//! * The client sends the connection preface (a predefined sequence of 24
//! octets).
//! * Both the client and the server sending a SETTINGS frame.
//!
//! See the [Starting HTTP/2] in the specification for more details.
//!
//! # Flow control
//!
//! [Flow control] is a fundamental feature of HTTP/2.0. The `h2` library
//! exposes flow control to the user.
//!
//! An HTTP/2.0 client or server may not send unlimited data to the peer. When a
//! stream is initiated, both the client and the server are provided with an
//! initial window size for that stream.  A window size is the number of bytes
//! the endpoint can send to the peer. At any point in time, the peer may
//! increase this window size by sending a `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame. Once a client
//! or server has sent data filling the window for a stream, no further data may
//! be sent on that stream until the peer increases the window.
//!
//! There is also a **connection level** window governing data sent across all
//! streams.
//!
//! Managing flow control for inbound data is done through [`FlowControl`].
//! Managing flow control for outbound data is done through [`SendStream`]. See
//! the struct level documentation for those two types for more details.
