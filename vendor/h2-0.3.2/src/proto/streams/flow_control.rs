// We don't want to send WINDOW_UPDATE frames for tiny changes, but instead
// aggregate them when the changes are significant. Many implementations do
// this by keeping a "ratio" of the update version the allowed window size.
//
// While some may wish to represent this ratio as percentage, using a f32,
// we skip having to deal with float math and stick to integers. To do so,
// the "ratio" is represented by 2 i32s, split into the numerator and
// denominator. For example, a 50% ratio is simply represented as 1/2.
//
// An example applying this ratio: If a stream has an allowed window size of
// 100 bytes, WINDOW_UPDATE frames are scheduled when the unclaimed change
// becomes greater than 1/2, or 50 bytes.
