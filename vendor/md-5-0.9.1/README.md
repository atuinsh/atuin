[![Build Status][build-image]][build-link]

Pure Rust implementation of the [MD5 hash function][1].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## ⚠️ Security Warning

This crate is provided for the purposes of legacy interoperability with
protocols and systems which mandate the use of MD5.

However, MD5 is [cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use][2].

Collision attacks against MD5 are both practical and trivial, and
[theoretical attacks against MD5's preimage resistance have been found][3].

[RFC6151][4] advises no new IETF protocols can be designed MD5-based constructions,
including HMAC-MD5.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.41** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.
