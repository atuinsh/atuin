//! This library provides [`eyre::Report`][Report], a trait object based
//! error handling type for easy idiomatic error handling and reporting in Rust
//! applications.
//!
//! This crate is a fork of [`anyhow`]  with a support for customized
//! error reports. For more details on customization checkout the docs on
//! [`eyre::EyreHandler`].
//!
//! ## Custom Report Handlers
//!
//! The heart of this crate is it's ability to swap out the Handler type to change
//! what information is carried alongside errors and how the end report is
//! formatted. This crate is meant to be used alongside companion crates that
//! customize it's behavior. Below is a list of known crates that export report
//! handlers for eyre and short summaries of what features they provide.
//!
//! - [`stable-eyre`]: Switches the backtrace type from `std`'s to `backtrace-rs`'s
//!   so that it can be captured on stable. The report format is identical to
//!   `DefaultHandler`'s report format.
//! - [`color-eyre`]: Captures a `backtrace::Backtrace` and a
//!   `tracing_error::SpanTrace`. Provides a `Help` trait for attaching warnings
//!   and suggestions to error reports. The end report is then pretty printed with
//!   the help of [`color-backtrace`], [`color-spantrace`], and `ansi_term`. Check
//!   out the README on [`color-eyre`] for details on the report format.
//! - [`simple-eyre`]: A minimal `EyreHandler` that captures no additional
//!   information, for when you do not wish to capture `Backtrace`s with errors.
//! - [`jane-eyre`]: A report handler crate that exists purely for the pun.
//!   Currently just re-exports `color-eyre`.
//!
//! ## Details
//!
//! - Use `Result<T, eyre::Report>`, or equivalently `eyre::Result<T>`, as the
//!   return type of any fallible function.
//!
//!   Within the function, use `?` to easily propagate any error that implements the
//!   `std::error::Error` trait.
//!
//!   ```rust
//!   # pub trait Deserialize {}
//!   #
//!   # mod serde_json {
//!   #     use super::Deserialize;
//!   #     use std::io;
//!   #
//!   #     pub fn from_str<T: Deserialize>(json: &str) -> io::Result<T> {
//!   #         unimplemented!()
//!   #     }
//!   # }
//!   #
//!   # struct ClusterMap;
//!   #
//!   # impl Deserialize for ClusterMap {}
//!   #
//!   use eyre::Result;
//!
//!   fn get_cluster_info() -> Result<ClusterMap> {
//!       let config = std::fs::read_to_string("cluster.json")?;
//!       let map: ClusterMap = serde_json::from_str(&config)?;
//!       Ok(map)
//!   }
//!   #
//!   # fn main() {}
//!   ```
//!
//! - Wrap a lower level error with a new error created from a message to help the
//!   person troubleshooting understand what the chain of failures that occured. A
//!   low-level error like "No such file or directory" can be annoying to debug
//!   without more information about what higher level step the application was in
//!   the middle of.
//!
//!   ```rust
//!   # struct It;
//!   #
//!   # impl It {
//!   #     fn detach(&self) -> Result<()> {
//!   #         unimplemented!()
//!   #     }
//!   # }
//!   #
//!   use eyre::{WrapErr, Result};
//!
//!   fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!       # return Ok(());
//!       #
//!       # const _: &str = stringify! {
//!       ...
//!       # };
//!       #
//!       # let it = It;
//!       # let path = "./path/to/instrs.json";
//!       #
//!       it.detach().wrap_err("Failed to detach the important thing")?;
//!
//!       let content = std::fs::read(path)
//!           .wrap_err_with(|| format!("Failed to read instrs from {}", path))?;
//!       #
//!       # const _: &str = stringify! {
//!       ...
//!       # };
//!       #
//!       # Ok(())
//!   }
//!   ```
//!
//!   ```console
//!   Error: Failed to read instrs from ./path/to/instrs.json
//!
//!   Caused by:
//!       No such file or directory (os error 2)
//!   ```
//!
//! - Downcasting is supported and can be by value, by shared reference, or by
//!   mutable reference as needed.
//!
//!   ```rust
//!   # use eyre::{Report, eyre};
//!   # use std::fmt::{self, Display};
//!   # use std::task::Poll;
//!   #
//!   # #[derive(Debug)]
//!   # enum DataStoreError {
//!   #     Censored(()),
//!   # }
//!   #
//!   # impl Display for DataStoreError {
//!   #     fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
//!   #         unimplemented!()
//!   #     }
//!   # }
//!   #
//!   # impl std::error::Error for DataStoreError {}
//!   #
//!   # const REDACTED_CONTENT: () = ();
//!   #
//!   # let error: Report = eyre!("...");
//!   # let root_cause = &error;
//!   #
//!   # let ret =
//!   // If the error was caused by redaction, then return a
//!   // tombstone instead of the content.
//!   match root_cause.downcast_ref::<DataStoreError>() {
//!       Some(DataStoreError::Censored(_)) => Ok(Poll::Ready(REDACTED_CONTENT)),
//!       None => Err(error),
//!   }
//!   # ;
//!   ```
//!
//! - If using the nightly channel, a backtrace is captured and printed with the
//!   error if the underlying error type does not already provide its own. In order
//!   to see backtraces, they must be enabled through the environment variables
//!   described in [`std::backtrace`]:
//!
//!   - If you want panics and errors to both have backtraces, set
//!     `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`;
//!   - If you want only errors to have backtraces, set `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE=1`;
//!   - If you want only panics to have backtraces, set `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` and
//!     `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE=0`.
//!
//!   The tracking issue for this feature is [rust-lang/rust#53487].
//!
//!   [`std::backtrace`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html#environment-variables
//!   [rust-lang/rust#53487]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53487
//!
//! - Eyre works with any error type that has an impl of `std::error::Error`,
//!   including ones defined in your crate. We do not bundle a `derive(Error)` macro
//!   but you can write the impls yourself or use a standalone macro like
//!   [thiserror].
//!
//!   ```rust
//!   use thiserror::Error;
//!
//!   #[derive(Error, Debug)]
//!   pub enum FormatError {
//!       #[error("Invalid header (expected {expected:?}, got {found:?})")]
//!       InvalidHeader {
//!           expected: String,
//!           found: String,
//!       },
//!       #[error("Missing attribute: {0}")]
//!       MissingAttribute(String),
//!   }
//!   ```
//!
//! - One-off error messages can be constructed using the `eyre!` macro, which
//!   supports string interpolation and produces an `eyre::Report`.
//!
//!   ```rust
//!   # use eyre::{eyre, Result};
//!   #
//!   # fn demo() -> Result<()> {
//!   #     let missing = "...";
//!   return Err(eyre!("Missing attribute: {}", missing));
//!   #     Ok(())
//!   # }
//!   ```
//!
//! ## No-std support
//!
//! **NOTE**: tests are currently broken for `no_std` so I cannot guarantee that
//! everything works still. I'm waiting for upstream fixes to be merged rather than
//! fixing them myself, so bear with me.
//!
//! In no_std mode, the same API is almost all available and works the same way. To
//! depend on Eyre in no_std mode, disable our default enabled "std" feature in
//! Cargo.toml. A global allocator is required.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! eyre = { version = "0.6", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! Since the `?`-based error conversions would normally rely on the
//! `std::error::Error` trait which is only available through std, no_std mode will
//! require an explicit `.map_err(Report::msg)` when working with a non-Eyre error
//! type inside a function that returns Eyre's error type.
//!
//! ## Comparison to failure
//!
//! The `eyre::Report` type works something like `failure::Error`, but unlike
//! failure ours is built around the standard library's `std::error::Error` trait
//! rather than a separate trait `failure::Fail`. The standard library has adopted
//! the necessary improvements for this to be possible as part of [RFC 2504].
//!
//! [RFC 2504]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2504-fix-error.md
//!
//! ## Comparison to thiserror
//!
//! Use `eyre` if you don't think you'll do anything with an error other than
//! report it. This is common in application code. Use `thiserror` if you think
//! you need an error type that can be handled via match or reported. This is
//! common in library crates where you don't know how your users will handle
//! your errors.
//!
//! [thiserror]: https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror
//!
//! ## Compatibility with `anyhow`
//!
//! This crate does its best to be usable as a drop in replacement of `anyhow` and
//! vice-versa by `re-exporting` all of the renamed APIs with the names used in
//! `anyhow`, though there are some differences still.
//!
//! #### `Context` and `Option`
//!
//! As part of renaming `Context` to `WrapErr` we also intentionally do not
//! implement `WrapErr` for `Option`. This decision was made because `wrap_err`
//! implies that you're creating a new error that saves the old error as its
//! `source`. With `Option` there is no source error to wrap, so `wrap_err` ends up
//! being somewhat meaningless.
//!
//! Instead `eyre` intends for users to use the combinator functions provided by
//! `std` for converting `Option`s to `Result`s. So where you would write this with
//! anyhow:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use anyhow::Context;
//!
//! let opt: Option<()> = None;
//! let result = opt.context("new error message");
//! ```
//!
//! With `eyre` we want users to write:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use eyre::{eyre, Result};
//!
//! let opt: Option<()> = None;
//! let result: Result<()> = opt.ok_or_else(|| eyre!("new error message"));
//! ```
//!
//! **NOTE**: However, to help with porting we do provide a `ContextCompat` trait which
//! implements `context` for options which you can import to make existing
//! `.context` calls compile.

///
/// ```rust,compile_fail

///
/// fn wrap_example(err: Result<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static>>) -> Result<(), Report> {

/// ```rust
/// use std::error::Error;
/// use eyre::{WrapErr, Report, eyre};
///
/// fn wrap_example(err: Result<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static>>) -> Result<(), Report> {

/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Effect on downcasting
///
/// After attaching a message of type `D` onto an error of type `E`, the resulting
/// `eyre::Error` may be downcast to `D` **or** to `E`.
///
/// That is, in codebases that rely on downcasting, Eyre's wrap_err supports
/// both of the following use cases:
///
///   - **Attaching messages whose type is insignificant onto errors whose type
///     is used in downcasts.**
///
///     In other error libraries whose wrap_err is not designed this way, it can
///     be risky to introduce messages to existing code because new message might
///     break existing working downcasts. In Eyre, any downcast that worked
///     before adding the message will continue to work after you add a message, so
///     you should freely wrap errors wherever it would be helpful.
///
