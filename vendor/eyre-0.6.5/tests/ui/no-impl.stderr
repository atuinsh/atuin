  = note: the method `eyre_kind` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `Error: Into<ErrReport>`
          which is required by `Error: eyre::private::kind::TraitKind`
          `Error: std::fmt::Display`
          which is required by `&Error: eyre::private::kind::AdhocKind`
          `&Error: Into<ErrReport>`
          which is required by `&Error: eyre::private::kind::TraitKind`
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
