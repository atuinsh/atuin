# Config

Atuin maintains two configuration files, stored in `~/.config/atuin/`. We store
data in `~/.local/share/atuin` (unless overridden by XDG\_\*).

You can also change the path to the configuration directory by setting
`ATUIN_CONFIG_DIR`. For example

```
export ATUIN_CONFIG_DIR = /home/ellie/.atuin
```

## Client config

```
~/.config/atuin/config.toml
```

The client runs on a user's machine, and unless you're running a server, this
is what you care about.

See [config.toml](../../../atuin-client/config.toml) for an example

### `db_path`

The path to the Atuin SQlite database. Defaults to
`~/.local/share/atuin/history.db`.

```
db_path = "~/.history.db"
```

### `key_path`

The path to the Atuin encryption key. Defaults to
`~/.local/share/atuin/key`.

```
key = "~/.atuin-key"
```

### `session_path`

The path to the Atuin server session file. Defaults to
`~/.local/share/atuin/session`. This is essentially just an API token

```
key = "~/.atuin-session"
```

### `dialect`

This configures how the [stats](../commands/stats.md) command parses dates. It has two
possible values

```
dialect = "uk"
```

or

```
dialect = "us"
```

and defaults to "us".

### `auto_sync`

Configures whether or not to automatically sync, when logged in. Defaults to
true

```
auto_sync = true/false
```

### `update_check`

Configures whether or not to automatically check for updates. Defaults to
true.

```
update_check = true/false
```

### `sync_address`

The address of the server to sync with! Defaults to `https://api.atuin.sh`.

```
sync_address = "https://api.atuin.sh"
```

### `sync_frequency`

How often to automatically sync with the server. This can be given in a
"human-readable" format. For example, `10s`, `20m`, `1h`, etc. Defaults to `1h`.

If set to `0`, Atuin will sync after every command. Some servers may potentially
rate limit, which won't cause any issues.

```
sync_frequency = "1h"
```

### `search_mode`

Which search mode to use. Atuin supports "prefix", "fulltext", "fuzzy", and
"skim" search modes.

Prefix mode searches for "query\*"; fulltext mode searches for "\*query\*";
"fuzzy" applies the [fuzzy search syntax](#fuzzy-search-syntax);
"skim" applies the [skim search syntax](https://github.com/lotabout/skim#search-syntax).

Defaults to "fuzzy".

#### `fuzzy` search syntax

The "fuzzy" search syntax is based on the
[fzf search syntax](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#search-syntax).

| Token     | Match type                 | Description                          |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `sbtrkt`  | fuzzy-match                | Items that match `sbtrkt`            |
| `'wild`   | exact-match (quoted)       | Items that include `wild`            |
| `^music`  | prefix-exact-match         | Items that start with `music`        |
| `.mp3$`   | suffix-exact-match         | Items that end with `.mp3`           |
| `!fire`   | inverse-exact-match        | Items that do not include `fire`     |
| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `music` |
| `!.mp3$`  | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.mp3`    |

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`,
or `py`.

```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

### `filter_mode`

The default filter to use when searching

| Column1          | Column2                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| global (default) | Search history from all hosts, all sessions, all directories |
| host             | Search history just from this host                           |
| session          | Search history just from the current session                 |
| directory        | Search history just from the current directory               |

Filter modes can still be toggled via ctrl-r

```
filter_mode = "host"
```

### `filter_mode_shell_up_key_binding`

The default filter to use when searching and being invoked from a shell up-key binding.

Accepts exactly the same options as `filter_mode` above

```
filter_mode_shell_up_key_binding = "session"
```

Defaults to the value specified for filter_mode.

### `workspaces`

This flag enables a pseudo filter-mode named "workspace": the filter is automatically
activated when you are in a git repository. Defaults to false.

With workspace filtering enabled, Atuin will filter for commands executed in any directory
within a git repository tree.

Filter modes can still be toggled via ctrl-r.

### `style`

Which style to use. Possible values: `auto`, `full` and `compact`.

- `compact`:

![compact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1710904/161623659-4fec047f-ea4b-471c-9581-861d2eb701a9.png)

- `full`:

![full](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1710904/161623547-42afbfa7-a3ef-4820-bacd-fcaf1e324969.png)

Defaults to `auto`.

### `invert`

Invert the UI - put the search bar at the top

### `inline_height`

Set the maximum number of lines Atuin's interface should take up.

![inline_height](../../blog/2023/04-01-release-v14/inline.png)

If set to `0` (default), Atuin will always take up as many lines as available (full screen).

### `show_preview`

Configure whether or not to show a preview of the selected command.

![show_preview](../../blog/2023/04-01-release-v14/preview.png)

Useful when the command is longer than the terminal width and is cut off.

### `max_preview_height`

Configure the maximum height of the preview to show.

Useful when you have long scripts in your history that you want to distinguish by more than the first few lines.

Defaults to `4`.

### `show_help`

Configure whether or not to show the help row, which includes the current Atuin version (and whether an update is available), a keymap hint, and the total amount of commands in your history.

Defaults to `true`.

### `exit_mode`

What to do when the escape key is pressed when searching

| Value                     | Behaviour                                                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| return-original (default) | Set the command-line to the value it had before starting search  |
| return-query              | Set the command-line to the search query you have entered so far |

Pressing ctrl+c or ctrl+d will always return the original command-line value.

```
exit_mode = "return-query"
```

### history_filter

The history filter allows you to exclude commands from history tracking - maybe you want to keep ALL of your `curl` commands totally out of your shell history, or maybe just some matching a pattern.

This supports regular expressions, so you can hide pretty much whatever you want!

```
## Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't start
## with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in the command.
history_filter = [
   "^secret-cmd",
   "^innocuous-cmd .*--secret=.+"
]
```

### secrets_filter

```
secrets_filter = true
```

Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include

1. AWS key id
2. Github pat (old and new)
3. Slack oauth tokens (bot, user)
4. Slack webhooks
5. Stripe live/test keys

## macOS <kbd>Ctrl-n</kbd> key shortcuts

macOS does not have an <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, although terminal emulators can often be configured to map the <kbd>Option</kbd> key to be used as <kbd>Alt</kbd>. *However*, remapping <kbd>Option</kbd> this way may prevent typing some characters, such as using <kbd>Option-3</kbd> to type `#` on the British English layout. For such a scenario, set the `ctrl_n_shortcuts` option to `true` in your config file to replace <kbd>Alt-0</kbd> to <kbd>Alt-9</kbd> shortcuts with <kbd>Ctrl-0</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl-9</kbd> instead:

```
# Use Ctrl-0 .. Ctrl-9 instead of Alt-0 .. Alt-9 UI shortcuts
ctrl_n_shortcuts = true
```
