> We have since released v14.0.1 with some fixes, following a NuShell breaking change. A writeup of other included changes will be included in the next release notes!

Announcing a new release of Atuin! v14 is out now. Atuin allows you to easily search and sync your shell history across many machines. Get started [here](https://atuin.sh/docs/)

You can update your installation via your system package manager, or by downloading the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/ellie/atuin/releases).

This release introduces some breaking changes, so please ensure all Atuin clients and servers are updated or sync may not complete. If you have any issues, please try `atuin sync --force`

We had a lot of changes in this release - I'll call out a few, but this is not exhaustive. Read the changelog below for the full list!

## New Features

### Deletions

You can now delete history! This has been our longest-standing issue, and one we are frequently asked about. So it's great to get it out! It took us a while due to the nature of sync, and we wanted to try several different approaches. There is still no way to delete history from the UI, however you can now pass the `--delete` flag to any `atuin search` command to delete all history matching the query. I suggest you run the search _without_ the delete flag first, just to check what you are removing

For example, to delete all commands that start with `psql`:

```
atuin search --delete --search-mode prefix psql
```

### NuShell

We now support NuShell! This was a huge effort by [@stevenxxiu](https://github.com/stevenxxiu), and involved work on both Atuin and NuShell itself. The effort was greatly appreciated, thank you so much ðŸ’–

Run in *Nushell*:

```
mkdir ~/.local/share/atuin/
atuin init nu | save ~/.local/share/atuin/init.nu
```

Add to `config.nu`:

```
source ~/.local/share/atuin/init.nu
```

PRs:
- https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8560
- https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8207
- https://github.com/ellie/atuin/pull/788

### Inline history UI

![inline history](inline.png)

Another of our biggest asks - the UI can now be configured so that it does not take the entire screen. Thank you to [@pdecat](https://github.com/pdecat)

Simply add 

```
# Choose a height for the inline history search
inline_height = 40
```

to your Atuin config file, and you're good to go!

We didn't sort it in time for v14, but in v15 you will also be able to configure the UI more deeply - for instance, change the position of the search bar.

### Skim fuzzy search

We have also added an alternative new search mode! This uses [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) behind the scenes. Check it out with `search_mode = "skim"`. Thank you [@conradludgate](https://github.com/conradludgate)

### Windows

Atuin now _provisionally_ supports Windows! We cannot provide full support + releases won't be tested to the same level on Windows, however a few contributors have now been building + running on the platform without issues. Thank you so much to [@YummyOreo](https://github.com/YummyOreo) for this one!

### Command preview

![preview](preview.png)

Previously, longer commands would be cut off in the UI. Thanks to [@pdecat](https://github.com/pdecat), we now have a preview window! Enable it with a `show_preview = true`

## Improvements

- Bash import improved
- Prefer PWD env variable over cwd to better handle symlinks
- Ignore common prefixes and subcommands in stats calculations
- Add musl build
- Add `atuin status` command to check sync status

## Sync server stats
I've ran a public sync server since the very beginning, and thought I'd share some stats from it! Bear in mind all data is encrypted, so the data we can see is only very high level.

In March, we saw:

- 2,031,355 history lines synced up, with a total of 13,077,001
- 137 new users, with a total of 1136 (we passed 1000!)

We also cleared 500 monthly active users for the first time! See the charts below for DAU/WAU/MAU
