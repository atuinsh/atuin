## prevent commands matching any of these regexes from being written to history.
## Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't start
## with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in the command.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# history_filter = [
#   "^secret-cmd",
#   "^innocuous-cmd .*--secret=.+"
# ]

## prevent commands run with cwd matching any of these regexes from being written
## to history. Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't
## start with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in CWD.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see

## Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include

## 4. Slack webhooks
## 5. Stripe live/test keys
# secrets_filter = true

## Defaults to true. If enabled, upon hitting enter Atuin will immediately execute the command. Press tab to return to the shell and edit.
# This applies for new installs. Old installs will keep the old behaviour unless configured otherwise.
