## prevent commands matching any of these regexes from being written to history.
## Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't start
## with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in the command.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# history_filter = [
#   "^secret-cmd",
#   "^innocuous-cmd .*--secret=.+",

## prevent commands run with cwd matching any of these regexes from being written
## to history. Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't
## start with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in CWD.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see

## Configure the maximum height of the preview to show.

## Configure whether or not to show the help row, which includes the current Atuin
## version (and whether an update is available), a keymap hint, and the total
## amount of commands in your history.
# show_help = true

## Configure whether or not to show tabs for search and inspect
# show_tabs = true

## Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include
## 1. AWS key id
## 2. Github pat (old and new)
## 3. Slack oauth tokens (bot, user)
## 4. Slack webhooks
## 5. Stripe live/test keys
# secrets_filter = true

## Defaults to true. If enabled, upon hitting enter Atuin will immediately execute the command. Press tab to return to the shell and edit.
# This applies for new installs. Old installs will keep the old behaviour unless configured otherwise.
enter_accept = true

## Defaults to "emacs".  This specifies the keymap on the startup of `atuin
## search`.  If this is set to "auto", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin
## search is automatically selected based on the shell's keymap where the
## keybinding is defined.  If this is set to "emacs", "vim-insert", or
## "vim-normal", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin search is forced to be
## the specified one.
# keymap_mode = "auto"

## Cursor style in each keymap mode.  If specified, the cursor style is changed
## in entering the cursor shape.  Available values are "default" and
## "{blink,steady}-{block,underline,bar}".
# keymap_cursor = { emacs = "blink-block", vim_insert = "blink-block", vim_normal = "steady-block" }

# network_connect_timeout = 5

## Timeout (in seconds) for acquiring a local database connection (sqlite)

## Set this to true and Atuin will minimize motion in the UI - timers will not update live, etc.
## Alternatively, set env NO_MOTION=true
# prefers_reduced_motion = false

[stats]
## Set commands where we should consider the subcommand for statistics. Eg, kubectl get vs just kubectl

## Set commands that should be totally stripped and ignored from stats
# common_prefix = ["sudo"]

## Set commands that will be completely ignored from stats
# ignored_commands = [
#   "cd",
#   "ls",
#   "vi"
# ]

[keys]
# Defaults to true. If disabled, using the up/down key won't exit the TUI when scrolled past the first/last entry.
# scroll_exits = false

[sync]
# Enable sync v2 by default
# This ensures that sync v2 is enabled for new installs only
# In a later release it will become the default across the board
